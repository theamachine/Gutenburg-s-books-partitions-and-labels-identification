       "'[The Parent\\'s Assistant, by Maria Edgeworth]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ORPHANS.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the ruins of the castle of Rossmore, in Ireland, is a small cabin,\\r\\nin which there once lived a widow and her four children.  As long as she\\r\\nwas able to work, she was very industrious, and was accounted the best\\r\\nspinner in the parish; but she overworked herself at last, and fell ill,\\r\\nso that she could not sit to her wheel as she used to do, and was obliged\\r\\nto give it up to her eldest daughter, Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was at this time about twelve years old.  One evening she was\\r\\nsitting at the foot of her mother\\'s bed spinning, and her little brothers\\r\\nand sisters were gathered round the fire eating their potatoes and milk\\r\\nfor supper.  \"Bless them, the poor young creatures!\" said the widow, who,\\r\\nas she lay on her bed, which she knew must be her deathbed, was thinking\\r\\nof what would become of her children after she was gone.  Mary stopped\\r\\nher wheel, for she was afraid that the noise of it had wakened her\\r\\nmother, and would hinder her from going to sleep again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No need to stop the wheel, Mary, dear, for me,\" said her mother, \"I was\\r\\nnot asleep; nor is it THAT which keeps me from sleep.  But don\\'t overwork\\r\\nyourself, Mary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no fear of that,\" replied Mary; \"I\\'m strong and hearty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So was I once,\" said her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so you will be again, I hope,\" said Mary, \"when the fine weather\\r\\ncomes again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The fine weather will never come again to me,\" said her mother.  \"\\'Tis a\\r\\nfolly, Mary, to hope for that; but what I hope is, that you\\'ll find some\\r\\nfriend--some help--orphans as you\\'ll soon all of you be.  And one thing\\r\\ncomforts my heart, even as I AM lying here, that not a soul in the wide\\r\\nworld I am leaving has to complain of me.  Though poor I have lived\\r\\nhonest, and I have brought you up to be the same, Mary; and I am sure the\\r\\nlittle ones will take after you; for you\\'ll be good to them--as good to\\r\\nthem as you can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the children, who had finished eating their suppers, came round the\\r\\nbed, to listen to what their mother was saying.  She was tired of\\r\\nspeaking, for she was very weak; but she took their little hands, as they\\r\\nlaid them on the bed and joining them all together, she said, \"Bless you,\\r\\ndears; bless you; love and help one another all you can.  Good night!--\\r\\ngood-bye!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary took the children away to their bed, for she saw that their mother\\r\\nwas too ill to say more; but Mary did not herself know how ill she was.\\r\\nHer mother never spoke rightly afterwards, but talked in a confused way\\r\\nabout some debts, and one in particular, which she owed to a\\r\\nschoolmistress for Mary\\'s schooling; and then she charged Mary to go and\\r\\npay it, because she was not able to GO IN with it.  At the end of the\\r\\nweek she was dead and buried, and the orphans were left alone in their\\r\\ncabin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two youngest girls, Peggy and Nancy, were six and seven years old.\\r\\nEdmund was not yet nine, but he was a stout-grown, healthy boy, and well\\r\\ndisposed to work.  He had been used to bring home turf from the bog on\\r\\nhis back, to lead cart-horses, and often to go on errands for gentlemen\\'s\\r\\nfamilies, who paid him a sixpence or a shilling, according to the\\r\\ndistance which he went, so that Edmund, by some or other of these little\\r\\nemployments, was, as he said, likely enough to earn his bread; and he\\r\\ntold Mary to have a good heart, for that he should every year grow able\\r\\nto do more and more, and that he should never forget his mother\\'s words\\r\\nwhen she last gave him her blessing, and joined their hands all together.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Peggy and Nancy, it was little that they could do; but they were\\r\\ngood children, and Mary, when she considered that so much depended upon\\r\\nher, was resolved to exert herself to the utmost.  Her first care was to\\r\\npay those debts which her mother had mentioned to her, for which she left\\r\\nmoney done up carefully in separate papers.  When all these were paid\\r\\naway, there was not enough left to pay both the rent of the cabin and a\\r\\nyear\\'s schooling for herself and sisters which was due to the\\r\\nschoolmistress in a neighbouring village.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was in hopes that the rent would not be called for immediately, but\\r\\nin this she was disappointed.  Mr. Harvey, the gentleman on whose estate\\r\\nshe lived, was in England, and, in his absence, all was managed by a Mr.\\r\\nHopkins, an agent, who was a HARD MAN.*  The driver came to Mary about a\\r\\nweek after her mother\\'s death, and told her that the rent must be brought\\r\\nin the next day, and that she must leave the cabin, for a new tenant was\\r\\ncoming into it; that she was too young to have a house to herself, and\\r\\nthat the only thing she had to do was to get some neighbour to take her\\r\\nand her brother and her sisters in for charity\\'s sake.\\r\\n\\r\\n*A hard-hearted man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe driver finished by hinting that she would not be so hardly used if\\r\\nshe had not brought upon herself the ill-will of Miss Alice, the agent\\'s\\r\\ndaughter.  Mary, it is true, had refused to give Miss Alice a goat upon\\r\\nwhich she had set her fancy; but this was the only offence of which she\\r\\nhad been guilty, and at the time she refused it her mother wanted the\\r\\ngoat\\'s milk, which was the only thing she then liked to drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary went immediately to Mr. Hopkins, the agent, to pay her rent; and she\\r\\nbegged of him to let her stay another year in her cabin; but this he\\r\\nrefused.  It was now September 25th, and he said that the new tenant must\\r\\ncome in on the 29th, so that she must quit it directly.  Mary could not\\r\\nbear the thoughts of begging any of the neighbours to take her and her\\r\\nbrother and sisters in FOR CHARITY\\'S SAKE; for the neighbours were all\\r\\npoor enough themselves.  So she bethought herself that she might find\\r\\nshelter in the ruins of the old castle of Rossmore where she and her\\r\\nbrother, in better times, had often played at hide and seek.  The kitchen\\r\\nand two other rooms near it were yet covered in tolerably well; and a\\r\\nlittle thatch, she thought, would make them comfortable through the\\r\\nwinter.  The agent consented to let her and her brother and sisters go in\\r\\nthere, upon her paying him half a guinea in hand, and promising to pay\\r\\nthe same yearly.\\r\\n\\r\\nInto these lodgings the orphans now removed, taking with them two\\r\\nbedsteads, a stool, chair and a table, a sort of press, which contained\\r\\nwhat little clothes they had, and a chest in which they had two hundred\\r\\nof meal.  The chest was carried for them by some of the charitable\\r\\nneighbours, who likewise added to their scanty stock of potatoes and turf\\r\\nwhat would make it last through the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese children were well thought of and pitied, because their mother was\\r\\nknown to have been all her life honest and industrious.  \"Sure,\" says one\\r\\nof the neighbours, \"we can do no less than give a helping hand to the\\r\\npoor orphans, that are so ready to help themselves.\"  So one helped to\\r\\nthatch the room in which they were to sleep, and another took their cow\\r\\nto graze upon his bit of land on condition of having half the milk; and\\r\\none and all said they should be welcome to take share of their potatoes\\r\\nand buttermilk if they should find their own ever fall short.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe half-guinea which Mr. Hopkins, the agent, required for letting Mary\\r\\ninto the castle, was part of what she had to pay to the schoolmistress,\\r\\nto whom above a guinea was due.  Mary went to her, and took her goat\\r\\nalong with her, and offered it in part of payment of the debt, but the\\r\\nschoolmistress would not receive the goat. She said that she could afford\\r\\nto wait for her money till Mary was able to pay it; that she knew her to\\r\\nbe an honest, industrious little girl, and she would trust her with more\\r\\nthan a guinea.  Mary thanked her; and she was glad to take the goat home\\r\\nagain, as she was very fond of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing now settled in their house, they went every day regularly to work;\\r\\nMaud spun nine cuts a day, besides doing all that was to be done in the\\r\\nhouse; Edmund got fourpence a day by his work; and Peggy and Annie earned\\r\\ntwopence apiece at the paper-mills near Navan, where they were employed\\r\\nto sort rags, and to cut them into small pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had done work one day, Annie went to the master of the paper-\\r\\nmill and asked him if she might have two sheets of large white paper\\r\\nwhich were lying on the press.  She offered a penny for the paper; but\\r\\nthe master would not take anything from her, but gave her the paper when\\r\\nhe found that she wanted it to make a garland for her mother\\'s grave.\\r\\nAnnie and Peggy cut out the garland, and Mary, when it was finished, went\\r\\nalong with them and Edmund to put it up.  It was just a month after their\\r\\nmother\\'s death.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened, at the time the orphans were putting up this garland, that\\r\\ntwo young ladies, who were returning home after their evening walk,\\r\\nstopped at the gate of the churchyard to look at the red light which the\\r\\nsetting sun cast upon the window of the church.  As the ladies were\\r\\nstanding at the gate, they heard a voice near them crying, \"O, mother!\\r\\nmother! are you gone for ever?\"  They could not see anyone, so they\\r\\nwalked softly round to the other side of the church, and there they saw\\r\\nMary kneeling beside a grave, on which her brothers and sisters were\\r\\nhanging their white garlands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children all stood still when they saw the two ladies passing near\\r\\nthem; but Mary did not know anybody was passing, for her face was hid in\\r\\nher hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabella and Caroline (so these ladies were called) would not disturb the\\r\\npoor children; but they stopped in the village to inquire about them.  It\\r\\nwas at the house of the schoolmistress that they stopped, and she gave\\r\\nthem a good account of these orphans.  She particularly commended Mary\\'s\\r\\nhonesty, in having immediately paid all her mother\\'s debts to the utmost\\r\\nfarthing, as far as her money would go.  She told the ladies how Mary had\\r\\nbeen turned out of her house, and how she had offered her goat, of which\\r\\nshe was very fond, to discharge a debt due for her schooling; and, in\\r\\nshort, the schoolmistress, who had known Mary for several years, spoke so\\r\\nwell of her that these ladies resolved that they would go to the old\\r\\ncastle of Rossmore to see her the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they went there, they found the room in which the children lived as\\r\\nclean and neat as such a ruined place could be made.  Edmund was out\\r\\nworking with a farmer, Mary was spinning, and her little sisters were\\r\\nmeasuring out some bogberries, of which they had gathered a basketful,\\r\\nfor sale.  Isabella, after telling Mary what an excellent character she\\r\\nhad heard of her, inquired what it was she most wanted; and Mary said\\r\\nthat she had just worked up all her flax, and she was most in want of\\r\\nmore flax for her wheel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabella promised that she would send her a fresh supply of flax, and\\r\\nCaroline bought the bogberries from the little girls, and gave them money\\r\\nenough to buy a pound of coarse cotton for knitting, as Mary said that\\r\\nshe could teach them how to knit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe supply of flax, which Isabella sent the next day, was of great\\r\\nservice to Mary, as it kept her in employment for above a month; and when\\r\\nshe sold the yarn which she had spun with it, she had money enough to buy\\r\\nsome warm flannel for winter wear.  Besides spinning well, she had\\r\\nlearned at school to do plain work tolerably neatly, and Isabella and\\r\\nCaroline employed her to work for them; by which she earned a great deal\\r\\nmore than she could by spinning.  At her leisure hours she taught her\\r\\nsisters to read and write; and Edmund, with part of the money which he\\r\\nearned by his work out of doors, paid a schoolmaster for teaching him a\\r\\nlittle arithmetic.  When the winter nights came on, he used to light his\\r\\nrush candles for Mary to work by.  He had gathered and stripped a good\\r\\nprovision of rushes in the month of August, and a neighbour gave him\\r\\ngrease to dip them in.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening, just as he had lighted his candles, a footman came in, who\\r\\nwas sent by Isabella with some plain work to Mary.  This servant was an\\r\\nEnglishman, and he was but newly come over to Ireland.  The rush candles\\r\\ncaught his attention; for he had never seen any of them before, as he\\r\\ncame from a part of England where they were not used.  Edmund, who was\\r\\nready to oblige, and proud that his candles were noticed showed the\\r\\nEnglishman how they were made, and gave him a bundle of rushes.*\\r\\n\\r\\n[*\"The proper species of rush,\" says White, in his \\'Natural History of\\r\\nSelborne,\\' \"seems to be the Juncus effusus, or common soft rush, which is\\r\\nto be found in moist pastures, by the sides of streams, and under\\r\\nhedges.  These rushes are in best condition in the height of summer, but\\r\\nmay be gathered so as to serve the purpose well quite on to autumn.  The\\r\\nlargest and longest are the best.  Decayed labourers, women, and children\\r\\nmake it their business to procure and prepare them.  As soon as they are\\r\\ncut, they must be flung into water, and kept there; for otherwise they\\r\\nwill dry and shrink, and the peel will not run.  When these junci are\\r\\nthus far prepared, they must lie out on the grass to be bleached and take\\r\\nthe dew for some nights, and afterwards be dried in the sun.  Some\\r\\naddress is required in dipping these rushes in the scalding fat or\\r\\ngrease; but this knack is also to be attained by practice.  A pound of\\r\\ncommon grease may be procured for fourpence, and about six pounds of\\r\\ngrease will dip a pound of rushes and one pound of rushes may be bought\\r\\nfor one shilling; so that a pound of rushes, medicated and ready for use,\\r\\nwill cost three shillings.\"]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant was pleased with his good nature in this trifling instance,\\r\\nand remembered it long after it was forgotten by Edmund.  Whenever his\\r\\nmaster wanted to send a messenger anywhere, Gilbert (for that was the\\r\\nservant\\'s name) always employed his little friend Edmund, whom, upon\\r\\nfurther acquaintance, he liked better and better.  He found that Edmund\\r\\nwas both quick and exact in executing commissions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, after he had waited a great while at a gentleman\\'s house for an\\r\\nanswer to a letter, he was so impatient to get home that he ran off\\r\\nwithout it.  When he was questioned by Gilbert why he did not bring an\\r\\nanswer, he did not attempt to make any excuse; he did not say, \"There was\\r\\nno answer, please your honour,\" or, \"They bid me not to wait,\" etc.; but\\r\\nhe told exactly the truth; and though Gilbert scolded him for being so\\r\\nimpatient as not to wait, yet his telling the truth was more to the boy\\'s\\r\\nadvantage than any excuse he could have made.  After this he was always\\r\\nbelieved when he said, \"There was no answer,\" or, \"They bid me not wait\";\\r\\nfor Gilbert knew that he would not tell a lie to save himself from being\\r\\nscolded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe orphans continued to assist one another in their work according to\\r\\ntheir strength and abilities; and they went on in this manner for three\\r\\nyears.  With what Mary got by her spinning and plain work, and Edmund by\\r\\nleading of cart-horses, going on errands, etc., and with little Peggy and\\r\\nAnne\\'s earnings, the family contrived to live comfortably.  Isabella and\\r\\nCaroline often visited them, and sometimes gave them clothes, and\\r\\nsometimes flax or cotton for their spinning and knitting; and these\\r\\nchildren did not EXPECT, that because the ladies did something for them,\\r\\nthey should do everything.  They did not grow idle or wasteful.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Edmund was about twelve years old, his friend Gilbert sent for him\\r\\none day, and told him that his master had given him leave to have a boy\\r\\nin the house to assist him, and that his master told him he might choose\\r\\none in the neighbourhood.  Several were anxious to get into such a good\\r\\nplace:  but Gilbert said that he preferred Edmund before them all,\\r\\nbecause he knew him to be an industrious, honest, good natured lad, who\\r\\nalways told the truth.  So Edmund went into service at the vicarage; and\\r\\nhis master was the father of Isabella and Caroline.  He found his new way\\r\\nof life very pleasant; for he was well fed, well clothed, and well\\r\\ntreated; and he every day learned more of his business, in which at first\\r\\nhe was rather awkward.  He was mindful to do all that Mr. Gilbert\\r\\nrequired of him; and he was so obliging to all his fellow-servants that\\r\\nthey could not help liking him.  But there was one thing which was at\\r\\nfirst rather disagreeable to him:  he was obliged to wear shoes and\\r\\nstockings, and they hurt his feet.  Besides this, when he waited at\\r\\ndinner he made such a noise in walking that his fellow-servants laughed\\r\\nat him.  He told his sister Mary of his distress, and she made for him,\\r\\nafter many trials, a pair of cloth shoes, with soles of platted hemp.*\\r\\nIn these he could walk without making the least noise; and as these shoes\\r\\ncould not be worn out of doors, he was always sure to change them before\\r\\nhe went out; and consequently he had always clean shoes to wear in the\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n[*The author has seen a pair of shoes, such as here described, made in a\\r\\nfew hours.]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was soon remarked by the men-servants that he had left off clumping so\\r\\nheavily, and it was observed by the maids that he never dirtied the\\r\\nstairs or passages with his shoes.  When he was praised for these things,\\r\\nhe said it was his sister Mary who should be thanked, and not he; and he\\r\\nshowed the shoes which she had made for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabella\\'s maid bespoke a pair immediately, and sent Mary a piece of\\r\\npretty calico for the outside.  The last-maker made a last for her, and\\r\\nover this Mary sewed the calico vamps tight.  Her brother advised her to\\r\\ntry platted packthread instead of hemp for the soles; and she found that\\r\\nthis looked more neat than the hemp soles, and was likely to last longer.\\r\\nShe platted the packthread together in strands of about half an inch\\r\\nthick, and these were served firmly together at the bottom of the shoe.\\r\\nWhen they were finished they fitted well, and the maid showed them to her\\r\\nmistress.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabella and Caroline were so well pleased with Mary\\'s ingenuity and\\r\\nkindness to her brother, that they bespoke from her two dozen of these\\r\\nshoes, and gave her three yards of coloured fustian to make them of, and\\r\\ngalloon for the binding.  When the shoes were completed, Isabella and\\r\\nCaroline disposed of them for her amongst their acquaintance, and got\\r\\nthree shillings a pair for them.  The young ladies, as soon as they had\\r\\ncollected the money, walked to the old castle, where they found\\r\\neverything neat and clean as usual.  They had great pleasure in giving to\\r\\nthis industrious girl the reward of her ingenuity, which she received\\r\\nwith some surprise and more gratitude.  They advised her to continue the\\r\\nshoemaking trade, as they found the shoes were liked, and they knew that\\r\\nthey could have a sale for them at the Repository in Dublin.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, encouraged by these kind friends, went on with her little\\r\\nmanufacture with increased activity.  Peggy and Anne platted the\\r\\npackthread, and basted the vamps and linings together ready for her.\\r\\nEdmund was allowed to come home for an hour every morning, provided he\\r\\nwas back again before eight o\\'clock.  It was summer time, and he got up\\r\\nearly, because he liked to go home to see his sisters, and he took his\\r\\nshare in the manufactory.  It was his business to hammer the soles flat:\\r\\nand as soon as he came home every morning he performed his task with so\\r\\nmuch cheerfulness and sang so merrily at his work, that the hour of his\\r\\narrival was always an hour of joy to the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had presently employment enough upon her hands.  Orders came to her\\r\\nfor shoes from many families in the neighbourhood, and she could not get\\r\\nthem finished fast enough.  She, however, in the midst of her hurry,\\r\\nfound time to make a very pretty pair, with neat roses, as a present for\\r\\nher schoolmistress, who, now that she saw her pupil in a good way of\\r\\nbusiness, consented to receive the amount of her old debt.  Several of\\r\\nthe children who went to her school were delighted with the sight of\\r\\nMary\\'s present, and went to the little manufactory at Rossmore Castle, to\\r\\nfind out how these shoes were made.  Some went from curiosity, others\\r\\nfrom idleness; but when they saw how happy the little shoemakers seemed\\r\\nwhilst busy at work, they longed to take some share in what was going\\r\\nforward.  One begged Mary to let her plat some packthread for the soles;\\r\\nanother helped Peggy and Anne to baste in the linings; and all who could\\r\\nget employment were pleased, for the idle ones were shoved out of the\\r\\nway.  It became a custom with the children of the village to resort to\\r\\nthe old castle at their play hours; and it was surprising to see how much\\r\\nwas done by ten or twelve of them, each doing but a little at a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning Edmund and the little manufacturers were assembled very\\r\\nearly, and they were busy at their work, all sitting round the meal\\r\\nchest, which served them for a table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My hands must be washed,\" said George, a little boy who came running in;\\r\\n\"I ran so fast that I might be in time, to go to work along with you all,\\r\\nthat I tumbled down, and look how I have dirtied my hands.  Most haste\\r\\nworst speed.  My hands must be washed before I can do anything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst George was washing his hands, two other little children, who had\\r\\njust finished their morning\\'s work, came to him to beg that he would blow\\r\\nsome soap bubbles for them, and they were all three eagerly blowing\\r\\nbubbles, and watching them mount into the air, when suddenly they were\\r\\nstartled by a noise as loud as thunder.  They were in a sort of outer\\r\\ncourt of the castle, next to the room in which all their companions were\\r\\nat work, and they ran precipitately into the room, exclaiming, \"Did you\\r\\nhear that noise?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought I heard a clap of thunder,\" said Mary, \"but why do you look so\\r\\nfrightened?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she finished speaking, another and a louder noise, and the walls round\\r\\nabout them shook.  The children turned pale and stood motionless; but\\r\\nEdmund threw down his hammer, and ran out to see what was the matter.\\r\\nMary followed him, and they saw that a great chimney of the old ruins at\\r\\nthe farthest side of the castle had fallen down, and this was the cause\\r\\nof the prodigious noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe part of the castle in which they lived seemed, as Edmund said, to be\\r\\nperfectly safe; but the children of the village were terrified, and\\r\\nthinking that the whole would come tumbling down directly, they ran to\\r\\ntheir homes as fast as they could.  Edmund, who was a courageous lad, and\\r\\nproud of showing his courage, laughed at their cowardice; but Mary, who\\r\\nwas very prudent, persuaded her brother to ask an experienced mason, who\\r\\nwas building at his master\\'s, to come and give his opinion, whether their\\r\\npart of the castle was safe to live in or not.  The mason came, and gave\\r\\nit as his opinion that the rooms they inhabited might last through the\\r\\nwinter but that no part of the ruins could stand another year.  Mary was\\r\\nsorry to leave a place of which she had grown fond, poor as it was,\\r\\nhaving lived in it in peace and contentment ever since her mother\\'s\\r\\ndeath, which was now nearly four years; but she determined to look out\\r\\nfor some other place to live in; and she had now money enough to pay the\\r\\nrent of a comfortable cabin.  Without losing any time, she went to the\\r\\nvillage that was at the end of the avenue leading to the vicarage, for\\r\\nshe wished to get a lodging in this village because it was so near to her\\r\\nbrother, and to the ladies who had been so kind to her.  She found that\\r\\nthere was one newly built house in this village unoccupied; it belonged\\r\\nto Mr. Harvey, her landlord, who was still in England; it was slated, and\\r\\nneatly fitted up inside; but the rent of it was six guineas a year, and\\r\\nthis was far above what Mary could afford to pay.  Three guineas a year\\r\\nshe thought was the highest rent for which she could venture to engage.\\r\\nBesides, she heard that several proposals had been made to Mr. Harvey for\\r\\nthis house, and she knew that Mr. Hopkins, the agent, was not her friend;\\r\\ntherefore she despaired of getting it.  There was no other to be had in\\r\\nthis village.  Her brother was still more vexed than she was, that she\\r\\ncould not find a place near him.  He offered to give a guinea yearly\\r\\ntowards the rent out of his wages; and Mr. Gilbert spoke about it for him\\r\\nto the steward, and inquired whether, amongst any of those who had given\\r\\nin proposals, there might not be one who would be content with a part of\\r\\nthe house, and who would join with Mary in paying the rent.  None could\\r\\nbe found but a woman, who was a great scold, and a man who was famous for\\r\\ngoing to law about every trifle with his neighbours.  Mary did not choose\\r\\nto have anything to do with these people.  She did not like to speak\\r\\neither to Miss Isabella or Caroline about it, because she was not of an\\r\\nencroaching temper; and when they had done so much for her, she would\\r\\nhave been ashamed to beg for more.  She returned home to the old castle,\\r\\nmortified that she had no good news to tell Anne and Peggy, who she knew\\r\\nexpected to hear that she had found a nice house for them in the village\\r\\nnear their brother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bad news for you, Peggy,\" cried she, as soon as she got home.  \"And bad\\r\\nnews for you, Mary,\" replied her sisters, who looked very sorrowful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your poor goat is dead,\" replied Peggy.  \"There she is, yonder, lying\\r\\nunder the great corner stone; you can just see her leg.  We cannot lift\\r\\nthe stone from off her, it is so heavy.  Betsy [one of the neighbour\\'s\\r\\ngirls] says she remembers, when she came to us to work early this\\r\\nmorning, she saw the goat rubbing itself, and butting with its horns\\r\\nagainst that old tottering chimney.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Many\\'s the time,\" said Mary, \"that I have driven the poor thing away\\r\\nfrom that place; I was always afraid she would shake that great ugly\\r\\nstone down upon her at last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goat, who had long been the favourite of Mary and her sisters, was\\r\\nlamented by them all.  When Edmund came, he helped them to move the great\\r\\nstone from off the poor animal, who was crushed so as to be a terrible\\r\\nsight.  As they were moving away this stone in order to bury the goat,\\r\\nAnne found an odd-looking piece of money, which seemed neither like a\\r\\nhalfpenny, nor a shilling, nor a guinea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here are more, a great many more of them,\" cried Peggy; and upon\\r\\nsearching amongst the rubbish, they discovered a small iron pot, which\\r\\nseemed as if it had been filled with these coins, as a vast number of\\r\\nthem were found about the spot where it fell.  On examining these coins,\\r\\nEdmund thought that several of them looked like gold, and the girls\\r\\nexclaimed with great joy--\"Oh, Mary! Mary! this is come to us just in\\r\\nright time--now you can pay for the slated house.  Never was anything so\\r\\nlucky!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mary, though nothing could have pleased her better than to have been\\r\\nable to pay for the house, observed that they could not honestly touch\\r\\nany of this treasure, as it belonged to the owner of the castle.  Edmund\\r\\nagreed with her, that they ought to carry it all immediately to Mr.\\r\\nHopkins, the agent. Peggy and Anne were convinced by what Mary said, and\\r\\nthey begged to go along with her and their brother, to take the coins to\\r\\nMr. Hopkins.  On their way they stopped at the vicarage, to show the\\r\\ntreasure to Mr. Gilbert, who took it to the young ladies, Isabella and\\r\\nCaroline, and told them how it had been found.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not only by their superior riches, but it is yet more by their\\r\\nsuperior knowledge, that persons in the higher rank of life may assist\\r\\nthose in a lower condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabella, who had some knowledge of chemistry, discovered, by touching\\r\\nthe coins with nitric acid, that several of them were of gold, and\\r\\nconsequently of great value.  Caroline also found out that many of the\\r\\ncoins were very valuable as curiosities.  She recollected her father\\'s\\r\\nhaving shown to her the prints of the coins at the end of each king\\'s\\r\\nreign, in \"Rapin\\'s History of England;\" and upon comparing these\\r\\nimpressions with the coins found by the orphans, she perceived that many\\r\\nof them were of the reign of Henry the Seventh, which, from their\\r\\nscarcity, were highly appreciated by numismatic collectors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabella and Caroline, knowing something of the character of Mr. Hopkins,\\r\\nthe agent, had the precaution to count the coins, and to mark each of\\r\\nthem with a cross, so small that it was scarcely visible to the naked\\r\\neye, though it was easily to be seen through a magnifying glass.  They\\r\\nalso begged that their father, who was well acquainted with Mr. Harvey,\\r\\nthe gentleman to whom Rossmore Castle belonged, to write to him, and tell\\r\\nhim how well these orphans had behaved about the treasure which they had\\r\\nfound.  The value of the coins was estimated at about thirty or forty\\r\\nguineas.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days after the fall of the chimney at Rossmore Castle, as Mary and\\r\\nher sisters were sitting at their work, there came hobbling in an old\\r\\nwoman, leaning on a crab stick, that seemed to have been newly cut.  She\\r\\nhad a broken tobacco-pipe in her mouth; her head was wrapped up in two\\r\\nlarge red and blue handkerchiefs, with their crooked corners hanging far\\r\\ndown over the back of her neck, no shoes on her broad feet, nor stockings\\r\\non her many-coloured legs.  Her petticoat was jagged at the bottom, and\\r\\nthe skirt of her gown turned up over her shoulders, to serve instead of a\\r\\ncloak, which she had sold for whisky.  This old woman was well known\\r\\namongst the country people by the name of Goody Grope:*  because she had,\\r\\nfor many years, been in the habit of groping in old castles, and in\\r\\nmoats,** and at the bottom of a round tower*** in the neighbourhood, in\\r\\nsearch of treasure.  In her youth she had heard someone talking, in a\\r\\nwhisper, of an old prophecy, found in a bog, which said that before many\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"St. Patrick\\'s days should come about,\\r\\n      There would be found\\r\\n      A treasure under ground,\\r\\n      By one within twenty miles round.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis prophecy made a deep impression upon her.  She also dreamed of it\\r\\nthree times:  and as the dream, she thought, was a sure token that the\\r\\nprophecy was to come true, she, from that time forwards, gave up her\\r\\nspinning-wheel and her knitting, and could think of nothing but hunting\\r\\nfor the treasure, that was to be found by one \"within twenty miles\\r\\nround.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[*Goody is not a word used in Ireland.  Collyogh is the Irish appellation\\r\\nof an old woman:  but as Collyogh might sound strangely to English ears,\\r\\nwe have translated it by the word Goody.\\r\\n**What are in Ireland called moats, are, in England, called Danish\\r\\nmounds, or barrows.\\r\\n***Near Kells, in Ireland, there is a round tower, which was in imminent\\r\\ndanger of being pulled down by an old woman\\'s rooting at its foundation,\\r\\nin hopes of finding treasure.]\\r\\n\\r\\nYear after year St. Patrick\\'s day came about, without her ever finding a\\r\\nfarthing by all her groping; and as she was always idle, she grew poorer\\r\\nand poorer.  Besides, to comfort herself for her disappointments, and to\\r\\ngive her spirits for fresh searches, she took to drinking.  She sold all\\r\\nshe had by degrees; but still she fancied that the lucky day would come\\r\\nsooner or later, THAT WOULD PAY FOR ALL.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoody Grope, however, reached her sixtieth year, without ever seeing this\\r\\nlucky day; and now, in her old age, she was a beggar, without a house to\\r\\nshelter her, a bed to lie on, or food to put into her mouth, but what she\\r\\nbegged from the charity of those who had trusted more than she had to\\r\\nindustry and less to LUCK.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, Mary, honey! give me a potato and a sup of something, for the love\\r\\no\\' mercy; for not a bit have I had all day, except half a glass of whisky\\r\\nand a halfpenny worth of tobacco!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary immediately set before her some milk, and picked a good potato out\\r\\nof the bowl for her.  She was sorry to see such an old woman in such a\\r\\nwretched condition.  Goody Grope said she would rather have spirits of\\r\\nsome kind or other than milk; but Mary had no spirits to give her; so she\\r\\nsat herself down close to the fire, and after she had sighed and groaned\\r\\nand smoked for some time, she said to Mary, \"Well, and what have you done\\r\\nwith the treasure you had the luck to find?\"  Mary told her that she had\\r\\ncarried it to Mr. Hopkins, the agent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s not what I would have done in your place,\" replied the old woman.\\r\\n\"When good luck came to you, what a shame to turn your back upon it!  But\\r\\nit is idle talking of what\\'s done--that\\'s past; but I\\'ll try my luck in\\r\\nthis here castle before next St. Patrick\\'s day comes about.  I was told\\r\\nit was more than twenty miles from our bog or I would have been here long\\r\\nago; but better late than never.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was much alarmed, and not without reason, at this speech; for she\\r\\nknew that if Goody Grope once set to work at the foundation of the old\\r\\ncastle of Rossmore, she would soon bring it all down.  It was in vain to\\r\\ntalk to Goody Grope of the danger of burying herself under the ruins, or\\r\\nof the improbability of her meeting with another pot of gold coins.  She\\r\\nset her elbow upon her knees, and stopping her ears with her hands bid\\r\\nMary and her sisters not to waste their breath advising their elders; for\\r\\nthat, let them say what they would, she would fall to work the next\\r\\nmorning, \"BARRING you\\'ll make it worth my while to let it alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what will make it worth your while to let it alone?\" said Mary; for\\r\\nshe saw that she must either get into a quarrel or give up her\\r\\nhabitation, or comply with the conditions of this provoking old woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf a crown, Goody Grope said, was the least she could be content to\\r\\ntake.  Mary paid the half-crown, and was in hopes that she had got rid\\r\\nfor ever of her tormentor, but she was mistaken, for scarcely was the\\r\\nweek at an end before the old woman appeared before her again, and\\r\\nrepeated her threats of falling to work the next morning, unless she had\\r\\nsomething given to her to buy tobacco.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day and the next, and the next, Goody Grope came on the same\\r\\nerrand, and poor Mary, who could ill-afford to supply her constantly with\\r\\nhalfpence, at last exclaimed, \"I am sure the finding of this treasure has\\r\\nnot been any good luck to us, but quite the contrary; and I wish we never\\r\\nhad found it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary did not yet know how much she was to suffer on account of this\\r\\nunfortunate pot of gold coins.  Mr. Hopkins, the agent, imagined that no\\r\\none knew of the discovery of this treasure but himself and these poor\\r\\nchildren; so, not being as honest as they were, he resolved to keep it\\r\\nfor his own use.  He was surprised some weeks afterwards to receive a\\r\\nletter from his employer, Mr. Harvey, demanding from him the coins which\\r\\nhad been discovered at Rossmore Castle.  Hopkins had sold the gold coins,\\r\\nand some of the others; and he flattered himself that the children, and\\r\\nthe young ladies, to whom he now found they had been shown, could not\\r\\ntell whether what they had seen were gold or not, and he was not in the\\r\\nleast apprehensive that those of Henry the Seventh\\'s reign should be\\r\\nreclaimed from him as he thought they had escaped attention.  So he sent\\r\\nover the silver coins and others of little value, and apologized for his\\r\\nnot having mentioned them before, by saying that he considered them as\\r\\nmere rubbish.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Harvey, in reply, observed that he could not consider as rubbish the\\r\\ngold coins which were amongst them when they were discovered; and he\\r\\ninquired why these gold coins, and those of the reign of Henry the\\r\\nSeventh, were not now sent to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hopkins denied that he had ever received any such; but he was\\r\\nthunderstruck when Mr. Harvey, in reply to this falsehood, sent him a\\r\\nlist of the coins which the orphans had deposited with him, and exact\\r\\ndrawings of those that were missing.  He informed him that this list and\\r\\nthese drawings came from two ladies who had seen the coins in question.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hopkins thought that he had no means of escape but by boldly\\r\\npersisting in falsehood.  He replied, that it was very likely such coins\\r\\nhad been found at Rossmore Castle, and that the ladies alluded to had\\r\\nprobably seen them; but he positively declared that they never came to\\r\\nhis hands; that he had restored all that were deposited with him; and\\r\\nthat, as to the others, he supposed they must have been taken out of the\\r\\npot by the children, or by Edmund or Mary on their way from the ladies\\'\\r\\nhouse to his.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe orphans were shocked and astonished when they heard, from Isabella\\r\\nand Caroline, the charge that was made against them.  They looked at one\\r\\nanother in silence for some moments.  Then Peggy exclaimed--\"Sure!  Mr.\\r\\nHopkins has forgotten himself strangely.  Does not he remember Edmund\\'s\\r\\ncounting the things to him upon the great table in his hall, and we all\\r\\nstanding by!  I remember it as well as if it was this instant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so do I,\" cried Anne.  \"And don\\'t you recollect, Mary, your picking\\r\\nout the gold ones, and telling Mr. Hopkins that they were gold; and he\\r\\nsaid you knew nothing of the matter; and I was going to tell him that\\r\\nMiss Isabella had tried them, and knew that they were gold? but just then\\r\\nthere came in some tenants to pay their rent, and he pushed us out, and\\r\\ntwitched from my hand the piece of gold which I had taken up to show him\\r\\nthe bright spot which Miss Isabella had cleaned by the stuff that she had\\r\\npoured on it?  I believe he was afraid I should steal it; he twitched it\\r\\nfrom my hand in such a hurry.  Do, Edmund; do, Mary--let us go to him,\\r\\nand put him in mind of all this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll go to him no more,\" said Edmund, sturdily.  \"He is a bad man--I\\'ll\\r\\nnever go to him again.  Mary, don\\'t be cast down--we have no need to be\\r\\ncast down--we are honest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True,\" said Mary; \"but is not it a hard case that we, who have lived, as\\r\\nmy mother did all her life before us, in peace and honesty with all the\\r\\nworld, should now have our good name taken from us, when--\"  Mary\\'s voice\\r\\nfaltered and stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It can\\'t be taken from us,\" cried Edmund, \"poor orphans though we are,\\r\\nand he a rich gentleman, as he calls himself.  Let him say and do what he\\r\\nwill, he can\\'t hurt our good name.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund was mistaken, alas! and Mary had but too much reason for her\\r\\nfears.  The affair was a great deal talked of; and the agent spared no\\r\\npains to have the story told his own way.  The orphans, conscious of\\r\\ntheir own innocence, took no pains about the matter; and the consequence\\r\\nwas, that all who knew them well had no doubt of their honesty; but many,\\r\\nwho knew nothing of them, concluded that the agent must be in the right\\r\\nand the children in the wrong.  The buzz of scandal went on for some time\\r\\nwithout reaching their ears, because they lived very retiredly.  But one\\r\\nday, when Mary went to sell some stockings of Peggy\\'s knitting at the\\r\\nneighbouring fair, the man to whom she sold them bid her write her name\\r\\non the back of a note, and exclaimed, on seeing it--\"Ho! ho! mistress;\\r\\nI\\'d not have had any dealings with you, had I known your name sooner.\\r\\nWhere\\'s the gold that you found at Rossmore Castle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in vain that Mary related the fact.  She saw that she gained no\\r\\nbelief, as her character was not known to this man, or to any of those\\r\\nwho were present.  She left the fair as soon as she could; and though she\\r\\nstruggled against it, she felt very melancholy.  Still she exerted\\r\\nherself every day at her little manufacture; and she endeavoured to\\r\\nconsole herself by reflecting that she had two friends left who would not\\r\\ngive up her character, and who continued steadily to protect her and her\\r\\nsisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsabella and Caroline everywhere asserted their belief in the integrity\\r\\nof the orphans, but to prove it was in this instance out of their power.\\r\\nMr. Hopkins, the agent, and his friends, constantly repeated that the\\r\\ngold coins were taken away in coming from their house to his; and these\\r\\nladies were blamed by many people for continuing to countenance those\\r\\nthat were, with great reason, suspected to be thieves.  The orphans were\\r\\nin a worse condition than ever when the winter came on, and their\\r\\nbenefactresses left the country to spend some months in Dublin.  The old\\r\\ncastle, it was true, was likely to last through the winter, as the mason\\r\\nsaid; but though the want of a comfortable house to live in was, a little\\r\\nwhile ago, the uppermost thing in Mary\\'s thoughts, now it was not so.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night as Mary was going to bed, she heard someone knocking hard at\\r\\nthe door.  \"Mary, are you up? let us in,\" cried a voice, which she knew\\r\\nto be the voice of Betsy Green, the postmaster\\'s daughter, who lived in\\r\\nthe village near them.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe let Betsy in, and asked what she could want at such a time of night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Give me sixpence, and I\\'ll tell you,\" said Betsy; \"but waken Anne and\\r\\nPeggy.  Here\\'s a letter just come by post for you, and I stepped over to\\r\\nyou with it; because I guessed you\\'d be glad to have it, seeing it is\\r\\nyour brother\\'s handwriting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPeggy and Anne were soon roused, when they heard that there was a letter\\r\\nfrom Edmund.  It was by one of his rush candles that Mary read it; and\\r\\nthe letter was as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR MARY, NANCY, AND LITTLE PEG,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Joy! joy!--I always said the truth would come out at last; and that he\\r\\ncould not take our good name from us.  But I will not tell you how it all\\r\\ncame about till we meet, which will be next week, as we are (I mean,\\r\\nmaster and mistress, and the young ladies--bless them!--and Mr. Gilbert\\r\\nand I) coming down to the vicarage to keep Christmas; and a happy\\r\\nChristmas \\'tis likely to be for honest folks.  As for they that are not\\r\\nhonest, it is not for them to expect to be happy, at Christmas, or any\\r\\nother time.  You shall know all when we meet.  So, till then, fare ye\\r\\nwell, dear Mary, Nancy, and little Peg.\\r\\n                 \"Your joyful and affectionate brother,    EDMUND.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo comprehend why Edmund is joyful, our readers must be informed of\\r\\ncertain things which happened after Isabella and Caroline went to Dublin.\\r\\nOne morning they went with their father and mother to see the magnificent\\r\\nlibrary of a nobleman, who took generous and polite pleasure in thus\\r\\nsharing the advantages of his wealth and station with all who had any\\r\\npretensions to science or literature.  Knowing that the gentleman who was\\r\\nnow come to see his library was skilled in antiquities, the nobleman\\r\\nopened a drawer of medals, to ask his opinion concerning the age of some\\r\\ncoins, which he had lately purchased at a high price.  They were the very\\r\\nsame which the orphans had found at Rossmore Castle.  Isabella and\\r\\nCaroline knew them again instantly; and as the cross which Isabella had\\r\\nmade on each of them was still visible through a magnifying glass, there\\r\\ncould be no possibility of doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nobleman, who was much interested both by the story of these orphans,\\r\\nand the manner in which it was told to him, sent immediately for the\\r\\nperson from whom he had purchased the coins.  He was a Jew broker.  At\\r\\nfirst he refused to tell them from whom he got them, because he had\\r\\nbought them, he said, under a promise of secrecy.  Being further pressed,\\r\\nhe acknowledged that it was made a condition in his bargain that he\\r\\nshould not sell them to anyone in Ireland, but that he had been tempted\\r\\nby the high price the present noble possessor had offered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, when the Jew was informed that the coins were stolen, and that\\r\\nhe would be proceeded against as a receiver of stolen goods, if he did\\r\\nnot confess the whole truth, he declared that he had purchased them from\\r\\na gentleman, whom he had never seen before or since; but he added, that\\r\\nhe could swear to his person, if he saw him again.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Mr. Hopkins, the agent, was at this time in Dublin, and Caroline\\'s\\r\\nfather posted the Jew, the next day, in the back-parlour of a banker\\'s\\r\\nhouse, with whom Mr. Hopkins had, on this day, appointed to settle some\\r\\naccounts.  Mr. Hopkins came--the Jew knew him--swore that he was the man\\r\\nwho had sold the coins to him; and thus the guilt of the agent and the\\r\\ninnocence of the orphans were completely proved.\\r\\n\\r\\nA full account of all that happened was sent to England to Mr. Harvey,\\r\\ntheir landlord, and a few posts afterwards there came a letter from him,\\r\\ncontaining a dismissal of the dishonest agent, and a reward for the\\r\\nhonest and industrious orphans.  Mr. Harvey desired that Mary and her\\r\\nsisters might have the slated house, rent free, from this time forward,\\r\\nunder the care of ladies Isabella and Caroline, as long as Mary or her\\r\\nsisters should carry on in it any useful business.  This was the joyful\\r\\nnews which Edmund had to tell his sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the neighbours shared in their joy, and the day of their removal from\\r\\nthe ruins of Rossmore Castle to their new house was the happiest of the\\r\\nChristmas holidays.  They were not envied for their prosperity; because\\r\\neverybody saw that it was the reward of their good conduct; everybody\\r\\nexcept Goody Grope.  She exclaimed, as she wrung her hands with violent\\r\\nexpressions of sorrow--\"Bad luck to me! bad luck to me!--Why didn\\'t I go\\r\\nsooner to that there castle?  It is all luck, all luck in this world; but\\r\\nI never had no luck.  Think of the luck of these childer, that have found\\r\\na pot of gold, and such great, grand friends, and a slated house, and\\r\\nall:  and here am I, with scarce a rag to cover me, and not a potato to\\r\\nput into my mouth!--I, that have been looking under ground all my days\\r\\nfor treasure, not to have a halfpenny at the last, to buy me tobacco!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the very reason that you have not a halfpenny,\" said Betsy.\\r\\n\"Here Mary has been working hard, and so have her two little sisters and\\r\\nher brother, for these five years past; and they have made money for\\r\\nthemselves by their own industry--and friends too--not by luck, but by--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Phoo! phoo!\" interrupted Goody Grope; \"don\\'t be prating; don\\'t I know as\\r\\nwell as you do, that they found a pot of gold, BY GOOD LUCK? and is not\\r\\nthat the cause why they are going to live in a slated house now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied the postmaster\\'s daughter; \"this house is given to them AS\\r\\nA REWARD--that was the word in the letter; for I saw it.  Edmund showed\\r\\nit to me, and will show it to anyone that wants to see.  This house was\\r\\ngiven to them \\'AS A REWARD FOR THEIR HONESTY.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLAZY LAWRENCE.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the pleasant valley of Ashton there lived an elderly woman of the name\\r\\nof Preston.  She had a small neat cottage, and there was not a weed to be\\r\\nseen in her garden.  It was upon her garden that she chiefly depended for\\r\\nsupport; it consisted of strawberry beds, and one small border for\\r\\nflowers.  The pinks and roses she tied up in nice nosegays, and sent\\r\\neither to Clifton or Bristol to be sold.  As to her strawberries, she did\\r\\nnot send them to market, because it was the custom for numbers of people\\r\\nto come from Clifton, in the summer time, to eat strawberries and cream\\r\\nat the gardens in Ashton.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the widow Preston was so obliging, active and good-humoured, that\\r\\neveryone who came to see her was pleased.  She lived happily in this\\r\\nmanner for several years; but, alas! one autumn she fell sick, and,\\r\\nduring her illness, everything went wrong; her garden was neglected, her\\r\\ncow died, and all the money which she had saved was spent in paying for\\r\\nmedicines. The winter passed away, while she was so weak that she could\\r\\nearn but little by her work; and when the summer came, her rent was\\r\\ncalled for, and the rent was not ready in her little purse as usual.  She\\r\\nbegged a few months\\' delay, and they were granted to her; but at the end\\r\\nof that time there was no resource but to sell her horse Lightfoot.  Now\\r\\nLightfoot, though perhaps he had seen his best days, was a very great\\r\\nfavourite. In his youth he had always carried the dame to the market\\r\\nbehind her husband; and it was now her little son Jem\\'s turn to ride him.\\r\\nIt was Jem\\'s business to feed Lightfoot, and to take care of him--a\\r\\ncharge which he never neglected, for, besides being a very good natured,\\r\\nhe was a very industrious boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will go near to break my Jem\\'s heart,\" said Dame Preston to herself,\\r\\nas she sat one evening beside the fire stirring the embers, and\\r\\nconsidering how she had best open the matter to her son, who stood\\r\\nopposite to her, eating a dry crust of bread very heartily for supper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jem,\" said the old woman, \"what, ar\\'t hungry?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That I am, brave and hungry!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay! no wonder, you\\'ve been brave hard at work--Eh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Brave hard!  I wish it was not so dark, mother, that you might just step\\r\\nout and see the great bed I\\'ve dug; I know you\\'d say it was no bad day\\'s\\r\\nwork--and oh, mother! I\\'ve good news:  Farmer Truck will give us the\\r\\ngiant strawberries, and I\\'m to go for \\'em tomorrow morning, and I\\'ll be\\r\\nback afore breakfast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless the boy! how he talks!--Four mile there, and four mile back\\r\\nagain, afore breakfast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, upon Lightfoot, you know, mother, very easily; mayn\\'t I?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, child!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why do you sigh, mother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Finish thy supper, child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve done!\" cried Jem, swallowing the last mouthful hastily, as if he\\r\\nthought he had been too long at supper--\"and now for the great needle; I\\r\\nmust see and mend Lightfoot\\'s bridle afore I go to bed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo work he set, by the light of the fire, and the dame having once more\\r\\nstirred it, began again with \"Jem, dear, does he go lame at all now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, Lightfoot!  Oh, la, no, not he--never was so well of his lameness\\r\\nin all his life.  He\\'s grown quite young again, I think, and then he\\'s so\\r\\nfat he can hardly wag.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless him--that\\'s right.  We must see, Jem, and keep him fat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For what, mother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For Monday fortnight at the fair.  He\\'s to be--sold!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lightfoot!\" cried Jem, and let the bridle fall from his hand; \"and WILL\\r\\nmother sell Lightfoot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"WILL? no:  but I MUST, Jem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MUST! who says you MUST? why MUST you, mother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must, I say, child.  Why, must not I pay my debts honestly; and must\\r\\nnot I pay my rent, and was not it called for long and long ago; and have\\r\\nnot I had time; and did not I promise to pay it for certain Monday\\r\\nfortnight, and am not I two guineas short; and where am I to get two\\r\\nguineas?  So what signifies talking, child?\" said the widow, leaning her\\r\\nhead upon her arm.  \"Lightfoot MUST go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJem was silent for a few minutes--\"Two guineas, that\\'s a great, great\\r\\ndeal.  If I worked, and worked, and worked ever so hard, I could no ways\\r\\nearn two guineas AFORE Monday fortnight--could I, mother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord help thee, no; not an\\' work thyself to death.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I could earn something, though, I say,\" cried Jem, proudly; \"and I\\r\\nWILL earn SOMETHING--if it be ever so little, it will be SOMETHING--and I\\r\\nshall do my very best; so I will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That I\\'m sure of, my child,\" said his mother, drawing him towards her\\r\\nand kissing him; \"you were always a good, industrious lad, THAT I will\\r\\nsay afore your face or behind your back;--but it won\\'t do now--Lightfoot\\r\\nMUST go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJem turned away struggling to hide his tears, and went to bed without\\r\\nsaying a word more.  But he knew that crying would do no good; so he\\r\\npresently wiped his eyes, and lay awake, considering what he could\\r\\npossibly do to save the horse.  \"If I get ever so little,\" he still said\\r\\nto himself, \"it will be SOMETHING; and who knows but landlord might then\\r\\nwait a bit longer? and we might make it all up in time; for a penny a day\\r\\nmight come to two guineas in time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how to get the first penny was the question.  Then he recollected\\r\\nthat one day, when he had been sent to Clifton to sell some flowers, he\\r\\nhad seen an old woman with a board beside her covered with various\\r\\nsparkling stones, which people stopped to look at as they passed, and he\\r\\nremembered that some people bought the stones; one paid twopence, another\\r\\nthreepence, and another sixpence for them; and Jem heard her say that she\\r\\ngot them amongst the neighbouring rocks:  so he thought that if he tried\\r\\nhe might find some too, and sell them as she had done.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning he wakened full of this scheme, jumped up, dressed\\r\\nhimself, and, having given one look at poor Lightfoot in his stable, set\\r\\noff to Clifton in search of the old woman, to inquire where she found her\\r\\nsparkling stones.  But it was too early in the morning, the old woman was\\r\\nnot at her seat; so he turned back again, disappointed.  He did not waste\\r\\nhis time waiting for her, but saddled and bridled Lightfoot, and went to\\r\\nFarmer Truck\\'s for the giant strawberries.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great part of the morning was spent in putting them into the ground;\\r\\nand, as soon as that was finished, he set out again in quest of the old\\r\\nwoman, whom, to his great joy, he spied sitting at her corner of the\\r\\nstreet with her board before her.  But this old woman was deaf and cross;\\r\\nand when at last Jem made her hear his questions, he could get no answer\\r\\nfrom her, but that she found the fossils where he would never find any\\r\\nmore.  \"But can\\'t I look where you looked?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look away, nobody hinders you,\" replied the old woman; and these were\\r\\nthe only words she would say.\\r\\n\\r\\nJem was not, however, a boy to be easily discouraged; he went to the\\r\\nrocks, and walked slowly along, looking at all the stones as he passed.\\r\\nPresently he came to a place where a number of men were at work loosening\\r\\nsome large rocks, and one amongst the workmen was stooping down looking\\r\\nfor something very eagerly; Jem ran up, and asked if he could help him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the man, \"you can; I\\'ve just dropped, amongst this heap of\\r\\nrubbish, a fine piece of crystal that I got to-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What kind of a looking thing is it?\" said Jem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"White, and like glass,\" said the man, and went on working whilst Jem\\r\\nlooked very carefully over the heap of rubbish for a great while.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" said the man, \"it\\'s gone for ever; don\\'t trouble yourself any\\r\\nmore, my boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s no trouble; I\\'ll look a little longer; we\\'ll not give it up so\\r\\nsoon,\" said Jem; and after he had looked a little longer, he found the\\r\\npiece of crystal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank\\'e,\" said the man, \"you are a fine little industrious fellow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJem, encouraged by the tone of voice in which the man spoke this,\\r\\nventured to ask him the same questions which he had asked the old woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One good turn deserves another,\" said the man; \"we are going to dinner\\r\\njust now, and shall leave off work--wait for me here, and I\\'ll make it\\r\\nworth your while.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJem waited; and, as he was very attentively observing how the workmen\\r\\nwent on with their work, he heard somebody near him give a great yawn,\\r\\nand, turning round, he saw stretched upon the grass, beside the river, a\\r\\nboy about his own age, who, in the village of Ashton, as he knew, went by\\r\\nthe name of Lazy Lawrence--a name which he most justly deserved, for he\\r\\nnever did anything from morning to night.  He neither worked nor played,\\r\\nbut sauntered or lounged about restless and yawning.  His father was an\\r\\nale-house keeper, and being generally drunk, could take no care of his\\r\\nson; so that Lazy Lawrence grew every day worse and worse.  However, some\\r\\nof the neighbours said that he was a good natured, poor fellow enough,\\r\\nand would never do anyone harm but himself; whilst others, who were\\r\\nwiser, often shook their heads, and told him that idleness was the root\\r\\nof all evil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, Lawrence!\" cried Jem to him, when he saw him lying upon the grass;\\r\\n\"what, are you asleep?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not quite.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you awake?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not quite.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you doing there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you thinking of?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What makes you lie there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know--because I can\\'t find anybody to play with me to-day.  Will\\r\\nyou come and play?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I can\\'t; I\\'m busy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Busy,\" cried Lawrence, stretching himself, \"you are always busy.  I\\r\\nwould not be you for the world, to have so much to do always.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I,\" said Jem, laughing, \"would not be you for the world, to have\\r\\nnothing to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey then parted, for the workman just then called Jem to follow him.  He\\r\\ntook him home to his own house, and showed him a parcel of fossils, which\\r\\nhe had gathered, he said, on purpose to sell, but had never had time\\r\\nenough to sell them.  Now, however, he set about the task; and having\\r\\npicked out those which he judged to be the best, he put them in a small\\r\\nbasket, and gave them to Jem to sell, upon condition that he should bring\\r\\nhim half of what he got.  Jem, pleased to be employed, was ready to agree\\r\\nto what the man proposed, provided his mother had no objection.  When he\\r\\nwent home to dinner, he told his mother his scheme, and she smiled, and\\r\\nsaid he might do as he pleased; for she was not afraid of his being from\\r\\nhome.  \"You are not an idle boy,\" said she; \"so there is little danger of\\r\\nyour getting into any mischief.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly Jem that evening took his stand, with his little basket, upon\\r\\nthe bank of the river, just at the place where people land from a ferry-\\r\\nboat, and the walk turns to the wells, and numbers of people perpetually\\r\\npass to drink the waters.  He chose his place well, and waited nearly all\\r\\nthe evening, offering his fossils with great assiduity to every\\r\\npassenger; but not one person bought any.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hallo!\" cried some sailors, who had just rowed a boat to land, \"bear a\\r\\nhand here, will you, my little fellow, and carry these parcels for us\\r\\ninto yonder house?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJem ran down immediately for the parcels, and did what he was asked to do\\r\\nso quickly, and with so much good-will, that the master of the boat took\\r\\nnotice of him, and, when he was going away, stopped to ask him what he\\r\\nhad got in his little basket; and when he saw that they were fossils, he\\r\\nimmediately told Jem to follow him, for that he was going to carry some\\r\\nshells he had brought from abroad to a lady in the neighbourhood who was\\r\\nmaking a grotto.  \"She will very likely buy your stones into the bargain.\\r\\nCome along, my lad; we can but try.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lady lived but a very little way off, so that they were soon at her\\r\\nhouse.  She was alone in her parlour, and was sorting a bundle of\\r\\nfeathers of different colours; they lay on a sheet of pasteboard upon a\\r\\nwindow seat, and it happened that as the sailor was bustling round the\\r\\ntable to show off his shells, he knocked down the sheet of pasteboard,\\r\\nand scattered all the feathers.  The lady looked very sorry, which Jem\\r\\nobserving, he took the opportunity, whilst she was busy looking over the\\r\\nsailor\\'s bag of shells, to gather together all the feathers, and sort\\r\\nthem according to their different colours, as he had seen them sorted\\r\\nwhen he first came into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is the little boy you brought with you?  I thought I saw him here\\r\\njust now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And here I am, ma\\'am,\" cried Jem, creeping from under the table, with\\r\\nsome few remaining feathers which he had picked from the carpet; \"I\\r\\nthought,\" added he, pointing to the others, \"I had better be doing\\r\\nsomething than standing idle, ma\\'am.\"  She smiled, and, pleased with his\\r\\nactivity and simplicity, began to ask him several questions; such as who\\r\\nhe was, where he lived, what employment he had, and how much a day he\\r\\nearned by gathering fossils.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the first day I ever tried,\" said Jem; \"I never sold any yet,\\r\\nand if you don\\'t buy \\'em now, ma\\'am, I\\'m afraid nobody else will; for\\r\\nI\\'ve asked everybody else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, then,\" said the lady, laughing, \"if that is the case, I think I\\r\\nhad better buy them all.\"  So, emptying all the fossils out of his\\r\\nbasket, she put half a crown into it.\\r\\n\\r\\nJem\\'s eyes sparkled with joy.  \"Oh, thank you, ma\\'am,\" said he, \"I will\\r\\nbe sure and bring you as many more, to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but I don\\'t promise you,\" said she, \"to give you half a crown, to-\\r\\nmorrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, perhaps, though you don\\'t promise it, you will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said the lady, \"do not deceive yourself; I assure you that I will\\r\\nnot.  THAT, instead of encouraging you to be industrious, would teach you\\r\\nto be idle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJem did not quite understand what she meant by this, but answered, \"I\\'m\\r\\nsure I don\\'t wish to be idle; what I want is to earn something every day,\\r\\nif I know how; I\\'m sure I don\\'t wish to be idle.  If you knew all, you\\'d\\r\\nknow I did not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you mean, IF I KNEW ALL?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I mean, if you knew about Lightfoot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who\\'s Lightfoot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, mammy\\'s horse,\" added Jem, looking out of the window; \"I must make\\r\\nhaste home, and feed him afore it gets dark; he\\'ll wonder what\\'s gone\\r\\nwith me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let him wonder a few minutes longer,\" said the lady, \"and tell me the\\r\\nrest of your story.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve no story, ma\\'am, to tell, but as how mammy says he must go to the\\r\\nfair Monday fortnight, to be sold, if she can\\'t get the two guineas for\\r\\nher rent; and I should be main sorry to part with him, for I love him,\\r\\nand he loves me; so I\\'ll work for him, I will, all I can.  To be sure, as\\r\\nmammy says, I have no chance, such a little fellow as I am, of earning\\r\\ntwo guineas afore Monday fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But are you willing earnestly to work?\" said the lady; \"you know there\\r\\nis a great deal of difference between picking up a few stones, and\\r\\nworking steadily every day, and all day long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" said Jem, \"I would work every day, and all day long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" said the lady, \"I will give you work.  Come here, to-morrow\\r\\nmorning, and my gardener will set you to weed the shrubberies, and I will\\r\\npay you sixpence a day.  Remember, you must be at the gates by six\\r\\no\\'clock.\"  Jem bowed, thanked her, and went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was late in the evening, and Jem was impatient to get home to feed\\r\\nLightfoot; yet he recollected that he had promised the man who had\\r\\ntrusted him to sell the fossils, that he would bring him half of what he\\r\\ngot for them; so he thought that he had better go to him directly; and\\r\\naway he went, running along by the waterside about a quarter of a mile,\\r\\ntill he came to the man\\'s house.  He was just come home from work, and\\r\\nwas surprised when Jem showed him the half-crown, saying, \"Look what I\\r\\ngot for the stones; you are to have half, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said the man, when he had heard his story, \"I shall not take half\\r\\nof that; it was given to you.  I expected but a shilling at the most, and\\r\\nthe half of that is but sixpence, and that I\\'ll take.  Wife, give the lad\\r\\ntwo shillings, and take this half-crown.\"  So the wife opened an old\\r\\nglove, and took out two shillings; and the man, as she opened the glove,\\r\\nput in his fingers, and took out a little silver penny.  \"There, he shall\\r\\nhave that into the bargain for his honesty--honesty is the best policy--\\r\\nthere\\'s a lucky penny for you, that I\\'ve kept ever since I can remember.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you ever go to part with it, do ye hear!\" cried the woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let him do what he will with it, wife,\" said the man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" argued the wife, \"another penny would do just as well to buy\\r\\ngingerbread; and that\\'s what it will go for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, that it shall not, I promise you,\" said Jem; and so he ran away\\r\\nhome, fed Lightfoot, stroked him, went to bed, jumped up at five o\\'clock\\r\\nin the morning, and went singing to work as gay as a lark.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour days he worked \"every day and all day long\"; and every evening the\\r\\nlady, when she came out to walk in her gardens, looked at his work.  At\\r\\nlast she said to her gardener, \"This little boy works very hard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never had so good a little boy about the grounds,\" said the gardener;\\r\\n\"he\\'s always at his work, let me come by when I will, and he has got\\r\\ntwice as much done as another would do; yes, twice as much, ma\\'am; for\\r\\nlook here--he began at this \\'ere rose-bush, and now he\\'s got to where you\\r\\nstand, ma\\'am; and here is the day\\'s work that t\\'other boy, and he\\'s three\\r\\nyears older too, did to-day--I say, measure Jem\\'s fairly, and it\\'s twice\\r\\nas much, I\\'m sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the lady to her gardener, \"show me how much is a fair day\\'s\\r\\nwork for a boy of his age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come at six o\\'clock and go at six? why, about this much, ma\\'am,\" said\\r\\nthe gardener, marking off a piece of the border with his spade.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, little boy,\" said the lady, \"so much shall be your task every day.\\r\\nThe gardener will mark it off for you; and when you\\'ve done, the rest of\\r\\nthe day you may do what you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJem was extremely glad of this; and the next day he had finished his task\\r\\nby four o\\'clock; so that he had all the rest of the evening to himself.\\r\\nHe was as fond of play as any little boy could be; and when he was at it\\r\\nhe played with all the eagerness and gaiety imaginable; so as soon as he\\r\\nhad finished his task, fed Lightfoot, and put by the sixpence he had\\r\\nearned that day, he ran to the playground in the village, where he found\\r\\na party of boys playing, and amongst them Lazy Lawrence, who indeed was\\r\\nnot playing, but lounging upon a gate, with his thumb in his mouth.  The\\r\\nrest were playing at cricket.  Jem joined them, and was the merriest and\\r\\nmost active amongst them; till, at last, when quite out of breath with\\r\\nrunning, he was obliged to give up to rest himself, and sat down upon the\\r\\nstile, close to the gate on which Lazy Lawrence was swinging.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why don\\'t you play, Lawrence?\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m tired,\" said Lawrence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tired of what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know well what tires me; grandmother says I\\'m ill, and I must\\r\\ntake something--I don\\'t know what ails me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, pugh! take a good race--one, two, three, and away--and you\\'ll find\\r\\nyourself as well as ever.  Come, run--one, two, three, and away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, no, I can\\'t run, indeed,\" said he, hanging back heavily; \"you know I\\r\\ncan play all day long if I like it, so I don\\'t mind play as you do, who\\r\\nhave only one hour for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much the worse for you.  Come, now, I\\'m quite fresh again, will you\\r\\nhave one game at ball? do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I tell you I can\\'t; I\\'m as tired as if I had been working all day\\r\\nlong as hard as a horse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ten times more,\" said Jem, \"for I have been working all day long, as\\r\\nhard as a horse, and yet you see I\\'m not a bit tired, only a little out\\r\\nof breath just now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s very odd,\" said Lawrence, and yawned, for want of some better\\r\\nanswer; then taking out a handful of halfpence,--\"See what I got from\\r\\nfather today, because I asked him just at the right time, when he had\\r\\ndrunk a glass or two; then I can get anything I want out of him--see! a\\r\\npenny, twopence, threepence, fourpence--there\\'s eightpence in all; would\\r\\nnot you be happy if you had EIGHTPENCE?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I don\\'t know,\" said Jem, laughing, \"for you don\\'t seem happy, and\\r\\nyou HAVE EIGHTPENCE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That does not signify, though.  I\\'m sure you only say that because you\\r\\nenvy me.  You don\\'t know what it is to have eightpence.  You never had\\r\\nmore than twopence or threepence at a time in all your life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJem smiled.  \"Oh, as to that,\" said he, \"you are mistaken, for I have at\\r\\nthis very time more than twopence, threepence, or eightpence either.  I\\r\\nhave--let me--see--stones, two shillings; then five days\\' work--that\\'s\\r\\nfive sixpences, that\\'s two shillings and sixpence; in all, makes four\\r\\nshillings and sixpence; and my silver penny, is four and sevenpence--four\\r\\nand sevenpence!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have not!\" said Lawrence, roused so as absolutely to stand upright,\\r\\n\"four and sevenpence, have you?  Show it me, and then I\\'ll believe you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Follow me, then,\" cried Jem, \"and I\\'ll soon make you believe me; come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it far?\" said Lawrence, following half-running, half-hobbling, till\\r\\nhe came to the stable, where Jem showed him his treasure.  \"And how did\\r\\nyou come by it--honestly?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Honestly! to be sure I did; I earned it all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord bless me, earned it! well, I\\'ve a great mind to work; but then it\\'s\\r\\nsuch hot weather, besides, grandmother says I\\'m not strong enough yet for\\r\\nhard work; and besides, I know how to coax daddy out of money when I want\\r\\nit, so I need not work.  But four and sevenpence; let\\'s see, what will\\r\\nyou do with it all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s a secret,\" said Jem, looking great.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can guess; I know what I\\'d do with it if it was mine.  First, I\\'d buy\\r\\npocketfuls of gingerbread; then I\\'d buy ever so many apples and nuts.\\r\\nDon\\'t you love nuts?  I\\'d buy nuts enough to last me from this time to\\r\\nChristmas, and I\\'d make little Newton crack \\'em for me, for that\\'s the\\r\\nworst of nuts; there\\'s the trouble of cracking \\'em.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, you never deserve to have a nut.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you\\'ll give me some of yours,\" said Lawrence, in a fawning tone; for\\r\\nhe thought it easier to coax than to work--\"you\\'ll give me some of your\\r\\ngood things, won\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall not have any of those good things,\" said Jem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, what will you do with all your money?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I know very well what to do with it; but, as I told you, that\\'s a\\r\\nsecret, and I sha\\'n\\'t tell it anybody.  Come now, let\\'s go back and play-\\r\\n-their game\\'s up, I daresay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLawrence went back with him, full of curiosity, and out of humour with\\r\\nhimself and his eightpence.  \"If I had four and sevenpence,\" said he to\\r\\nhimself, \"I certainly should be happy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, as usual, Jem jumped up before six o\\'clock and went to his\\r\\nwork, whilst Lazy Lawrence sauntered about without knowing what to do\\r\\nwith himself.  In the course of two days he laid out sixpence of his\\r\\nmoney in apples and gingerbread; and as long as these lasted, he found\\r\\nhimself well received by his companions; but, at length the third day he\\r\\nspent his last halfpenny, and when it was gone, unfortunately some nuts\\r\\ntempted him very much, but he had no money to pay for them; so he ran\\r\\nhome to coax his father, as he called it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he got home he heard his father talking very loud, and at first he\\r\\nthought he was drunk; but when he opened the kitchen door, he saw that he\\r\\nwas not drunk, but angry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You lazy dog!\" cried he, turning suddenly upon Lawrence, and gave him\\r\\nsuch a violent box on the ear as made the light flash from his eyes; \"you\\r\\nlazy dog!  See what you\\'ve done for me--look!--look, look, I say!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLawrence looked as soon as he came to the use of his senses, and with\\r\\nfear, amazement and remorse, beheld at least a dozen bottles burst, and\\r\\nthe fine Worcestershire cider streaming over the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, did not I order you three days ago to carry these bottles to the\\r\\ncellar, and did not I charge you to wire the corks? answer me, you lazy\\r\\nrascal; did not I?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Lawrence, scratching his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why was not it done, I ask you?\" cried his father, with renewed\\r\\nanger, as another bottle burst at the moment.  \"What do you stand there\\r\\nfor, you lazy brat? why don\\'t you move, I say?  No, no,\" catching hold of\\r\\nhim, \"I believe you can\\'t move; but I\\'ll make you.\"  And he shook him\\r\\ntill Lawrence was so giddy he could not stand.  \"What had you to think\\r\\nof?  What had you to do all day long that you could not carry my cider,\\r\\nmy Worcestershire cider, to the cellar when I bid you?  But go, you\\'ll\\r\\nnever be good for anything; you are such a lazy rascal--get out of my\\r\\nsight!\"  So saying, he pushed him out of the house door, and Lawrence\\r\\nsneaked off, seeing that this was no time to make his petition for\\r\\nhalfpence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day he saw the nuts again, and wishing for them more than ever,\\r\\nhe went home, in hopes that his father, as he said to himself, would be\\r\\nin a better humour.  But the cider was still fresh in his recollection;\\r\\nand the moment Lawrence began to whisper the word \"halfpenny\" in his ear,\\r\\nhis father swore, with a loud oath, \"I will not give you a halfpenny, no,\\r\\nnot a farthing, for a month to come.  If you want money, go work for it;\\r\\nI\\'ve had enough of your laziness--go work!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt these terrible words Lawrence burst into tears, and, going to the side\\r\\nof a ditch, sat down and cried for an hour; and when he had cried till he\\r\\ncould cry no more, he exerted himself so far as to empty his pockets, to\\r\\nsee whether there might not happen to be one halfpenny left; and, to his\\r\\ngreat joy, in the farthest corner of his pocket one halfpenny was found.\\r\\nWith this he proceeded to the fruit woman\\'s stall.  She was busy weighing\\r\\nout some plums, so he was obliged to wait; and whilst he was waiting he\\r\\nheard some people near him talking and laughing very loud.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fruit woman\\'s stall was at the gate of an inn yard; and peeping\\r\\nthrough the gate in this yard, Lawrence saw a postilion and a stable boy,\\r\\nabout his own size, playing at pitch farthing.  He stood by watching them\\r\\nfor a few minutes.  \"I began but with one halfpenny,\" cried the stable\\r\\nboy, with an oath, \"and now I\\'ve got twopence!\" added he, jingling the\\r\\nhalfpence in his waistcoat pocket.  Lawrence was moved at the sound, and\\r\\nsaid to himself, \"If _I_ begin with one halfpenny I may end, like him,\\r\\nwith having twopence; and it is easier to play at pitch farthing than to\\r\\nwork.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he stepped forward, presenting his halfpenny, offering to toss up with\\r\\nthe stable boy, who, after looking him full in the face, accepted the\\r\\nproposal, and threw his halfpenny into the air.  \"Head or tail?\" cried\\r\\nhe.  \"Head,\" replied Lawrence, and it came up head.  He seized the penny,\\r\\nsurprised at his own success, and would have gone instantly to have laid\\r\\nit out in nuts; but the stable boy stopped him, and tempted him to throw\\r\\nagain.  This time Lawrence lost; he threw again and won; and so he went\\r\\non, sometimes losing, but most frequently winning, till half the morning\\r\\nwas lost.  At last, however, finding himself the master of three\\r\\nhalfpence, said he would play no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stable boy, grumbling, swore he would have his revenge another time,\\r\\nand Lawrence went and bought his nuts.  \"It is a good thing,\" said he to\\r\\nhimself, \"to play at pitch farthing; the next time I want a halfpenny\\r\\nI\\'ll not ask my father for it, nor go to work neither.\"  Satisfied with\\r\\nthis resolution, he sat down to crack his nuts at his leisure, upon the\\r\\nhorse block in the inn yard.  Here, whilst he ate, he overheard the\\r\\nconversation of the stable boys and postilions.  At first their shocking\\r\\noaths and loud wrangling frightened and shocked him; for Lawrence, though\\r\\nlazy, had not yet learned to be a wicked boy.  But, by degrees, he was\\r\\naccustomed to the swearing and quarrelling, and took a delight and\\r\\ninterest in their disputes and battles.  As this was an amusement which\\r\\nhe could enjoy without any sort of exertion, he soon grew so fond of it,\\r\\nthat every day he returned to the stable yard, and the horse block became\\r\\nhis constant seat.  Here he found some relief from the insupportable\\r\\nfatigue of doing nothing, and here, hour after hour, with his elbows on\\r\\nhis knees, and his head on his hands, he sat, the spectator of\\r\\nwickedness.  Gaming, cheating and lying soon became familiar to him; and,\\r\\nto complete his ruin, he formed a sudden and close intimacy with the\\r\\nstable boy (a very bad boy) with whom he had first begun to game.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consequences of this intimacy we shall presently see.  But it is now\\r\\ntime to inquire what little Jem had been doing all this while.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, after Jem had finished his task, the gardener asked him to stay\\r\\na little while, to help him to carry some geranium pots into the hall.\\r\\nJem, always active and obliging, readily stayed from play, and was\\r\\ncarrying in a heavy flower pot, when his mistress crossed the hall.\\r\\n\"What a terrible litter!\" said she, \"you are making here--why don\\'t you\\r\\nwipe your shoes upon the mat?\"  Jem turned to look for the mat, but he\\r\\nsaw none.  \"Oh,\" said the lady recollecting herself, \"I can\\'t blame you,\\r\\nfor there is no mat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am,\" said the gardener, \"nor I don\\'t know when, if ever, the man\\r\\nwill bring home those mats you bespoke, ma\\'am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very sorry to hear that,\" said the lady; \"I wish we could find\\r\\nsomebody who would do them, if he can\\'t.  I should not care what sort of\\r\\nmats they were, so that one could wipe one\\'s feet on them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJem, as he was sweeping away the litter, when he heard these last words,\\r\\nsaid to himself, \"Perhaps I could make a mat.\"  And all the way home, as\\r\\nhe trudged along whistling, he was thinking over a scheme for making\\r\\nmats, which, however bold it may appear, he did not despair of executing,\\r\\nwith patience and industry.  Many were the difficulties which his\\r\\n\"prophetic eye\" foresaw; but he felt within himself that spirit which\\r\\nspurs men on to great enterprises, and makes them \"trample on\\r\\nimpossibilities.\"  In the first place, he recollected that he had seen\\r\\nLazy Lawrence, whilst he lounged upon the gate, twist a bit of heath into\\r\\ndifferent shapes; and he thought, that if he could find some way of\\r\\nplaiting heath firmly together, it would make a very pretty green soft\\r\\nmat, which would do very well for one to wipe one\\'s shoes on.  About a\\r\\nmile from his mother\\'s house, on the common which Jem rode over when he\\r\\nwent to Farmer Truck\\'s for the giant strawberries, he remembered to have\\r\\nseen a great quantity of this heath; and, as it was now only six o\\'clock\\r\\nin the evening, he knew that he should have time to feed Lightfoot,\\r\\nstroke him, go to the common, return, and make one trial of his skill\\r\\nbefore he went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLightfoot carried him swiftly to the common, and there Jem gathered as\\r\\nmuch of the heath as he thought he should want.  But what toil! what\\r\\ntime! what pains did it cost him, before he could make anything like a\\r\\nmat!  Twenty times he was ready to throw aside the heath, and give up his\\r\\nproject, from impatience of repeated disappointments.  But still he\\r\\npersevered.  Nothing TRULY GREAT can be accomplished without toil and\\r\\ntime.  Two hours he worked before he went to bed.  All his play hours the\\r\\nnext day he spent at his mat; which, in all, made five hours of fruitless\\r\\nattempts.  The sixth, however, repaid him for the labours of the other\\r\\nfive.  He conquered his grand difficulty of fastening the heath\\r\\nsubstantially together, and at length completely finished a mat, which\\r\\nfar surpassed his most sanguine expectations.  He was extremely happy--\\r\\nsang, danced round it--whistled--looked at it again and again, and could\\r\\nhardly leave off looking at it when it was time to go to bed.  He laid it\\r\\nby his bedside, that he might see it the moment he awoke in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now came the grand pleasure of carrying it to his mistress.  She\\r\\nlooked fully as much surprised as he expected, when she saw it, and when\\r\\nshe heard who made it.  After having duly admired it, she asked how much\\r\\nhe expected for his mat.  \"Expect!--Nothing, ma\\'am,\" said Jem; \"I meant\\r\\nto give it you, if you\\'d have it; I did not mean to sell it.  I made it\\r\\nin my play hours, I was very happy in making it; and I\\'m very glad, too,\\r\\nthat you like it; and if you please to keep it, ma\\'am, that\\'s all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that\\'s not all,\" said the lady.  \"Spend your time no more in weeding\\r\\nin my garden, you can employ yourself much better; you shall have the\\r\\nreward of your ingenuity as well as of your industry.  Make as many more\\r\\nsuch mats as you can, and I will take care and dispose of them for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank\\'e, ma\\'am,\" said Jem, making his best bow, for he thought by the\\r\\nlady\\'s looks that she meant to do him a favour, though he repeated to\\r\\nhimself, \"Dispose of them, what does that mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day he went to work to make more mats, and he soon learned to\\r\\nmake them so well and quickly, that he was surprised at his own success.\\r\\nIn every one he made he found less difficulty, so that, instead of making\\r\\ntwo, he could soon make four in a day.  In a fortnight he made eighteen.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Saturday night when he finished, and he carried, at three\\r\\njourneys, his eighteen mats to his mistress\\' house; piled them all up in\\r\\nthe hall, and stood with his hat off, with a look of proud humility,\\r\\nbeside the pile, waiting for his mistress\\' appearance.  Presently a\\r\\nfolding-door, at one end of the hall, opened, and he saw his mistress,\\r\\nwith a great many gentlemen and ladies, rising from several tables.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! there is my little boy and his mats,\" cried the lady; and, followed\\r\\nby all the rest of the company, she came into the hall.  Jem modestly\\r\\nretired whilst they looked at his mats; but in a minute or two his\\r\\nmistress beckoned to him, and when he came into the middle of the circle,\\r\\nhe saw that his pile of mats had disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the lady, smiling, \"what do you see that makes you look so\\r\\nsurprised?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That all my mats are gone,\" said Jem; \"but you are very welcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are we?\" said the lady, \"well, take up your hat and go home then, for\\r\\nyou see that it is getting late, and you know Lightfoot will wonder\\r\\nwhat\\'s become of you.\"  Jem turned round to take up his hat, which he had\\r\\nleft on the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how his countenance changed! the hat was heavy with shillings.\\r\\nEveryone who had taken a mat had put in two shillings; so that for the\\r\\neighteen mats he had got thirty-six shillings.  \"Thirty-six shillings,\"\\r\\nsaid the lady; \"five and sevenpence I think you told me you had earned\\r\\nalready--how much does that make?  I must add, I believe, one other\\r\\nsixpence to make out your two guineas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two guineas!\" exclaimed Jem, now quite conquering his bashfulness, for\\r\\nat the moment he forgot where he was, and saw nobody that was by.  \"Two\\r\\nguineas!\" cried he, clapping his hands together,--\"O, Lightfoot!  O,\\r\\nmother!\"  Then, recollecting himself, he saw his mistress, whom he now\\r\\nlooked up to quite as a friend.  \"Will YOU thank them all?\" said he,\\r\\nscarcely daring to glance his eyes round upon the company; \"will YOU\\r\\nthank \\'em, for you know I don\\'t know how to thank \\'em RIGHTLY.\"\\r\\nEverybody thought, however, that they had been thanked RIGHTLY.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now we won\\'t keep you any longer, only,\" said his mistress, \"I have one\\r\\nthing to ask you, that I may be by when you show your treasure to your\\r\\nmother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, then,\" said Jem, \"come with me now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not now,\" said the lady, laughing; \"but I will come to Ashton to-morrow\\r\\nevening; perhaps your mother can find me a few strawberries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That she will,\" said Jem:  \"I\\'ll search the garden myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe now went home, but felt it a great restraint to wait till to-morrow\\r\\nevening before he told his mother.  To console himself he flew to the\\r\\nstable:--\"Lightfoot, you\\'re not to be sold on Monday, poor fellow!\" said\\r\\nhe, patting him, and then could not refrain from counting out his money.\\r\\nWhilst he was intent upon this, Jem was startled by a noise at the door:\\r\\nsomebody was trying to pull up the latch.  It opened, and there came in\\r\\nLazy Lawrence, with a boy in a red jacket, who had a cock under his arm.\\r\\nThey started when they got into the middle of the stable, and when they\\r\\nsaw Jem, who had been at first hidden by the horse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We--we--we came,\" stammered Lazy Lawrence--\"I mean, I came to--to--to--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To ask you,\" continued the stable-boy, in a bold tone, \"whether you will\\r\\ngo with us to the cock-fight on Monday?  See, I\\'ve a fine cock here, and\\r\\nLawrence told me you were a great friend of his; so I came.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLawrence now attempted to say something in praise of the pleasures of\\r\\ncock-fighting and in recommendation of his new companion.  But Jem looked\\r\\nat the stable-boy with dislike, and a sort of dread.  Then turning his\\r\\neyes upon the cock with a look of compassion, said, in a low voice, to\\r\\nLawrence, \"Shall you like to stand by and see its eyes pecked out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Lawrence, \"as to that; but they say a cockfight\\'s a\\r\\nfine sight, and it\\'s no more cruel in me to go than another; and a great\\r\\nmany go, and I\\'ve nothing else to do, so I shall go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I have something else to do,\" said Jem, laughing, \"so I shall not\\r\\ngo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" continued Lawrence, \"you know Monday is the great Bristol fair,\\r\\nand one must be merry then, of all the days in the year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One day in the year, sure, there\\'s no harm in being merry,\" said the\\r\\nstable boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not,\" said Jem; \"for I know for my part, I am merry every day in\\r\\nthe year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s very odd,\" said Lawrence; \"but I know for my part, I would not\\r\\nfor all the world miss going to the fair, for at least it will be\\r\\nsomething to talk of for half a year after.  Come, you\\'ll go, won\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Jem, still looking as if he did not like to talk before the\\r\\nill-looking stranger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then what will you do with all your money?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll tell you about that another time,\" whispered Jem; \"and don\\'t you go\\r\\nto see that cock\\'s eyes pecked out; it won\\'t make you merry, I\\'m sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I had anything else to divert me,\" said Lawrence, hesitating and\\r\\nyawning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" cried the stable boy, seizing his stretching arm, \"come along,\"\\r\\ncried he; and, pulling him away from Jem, upon whom he cast a look of\\r\\nextreme contempt; \"leave him alone, he\\'s not the sort.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a fool you are,\" said he to Lawrence, the moment he got him out of\\r\\nthe stable; \"you might have known he would not go, else we should soon\\r\\nhave trimmed him out of his four and sevenpence.  But how came you to\\r\\ntalk of four and sevenpence.  I saw in the manger a hat full of silver.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\" exclaimed Lawrence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed; but why did you stammer so when we first got in?  You had\\r\\nliked to have blown us all up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was so ashamed,\" said Lawrence, hanging down his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ashamed! but you must not talk of shame now you are in for it, and I\\r\\nsha\\'n\\'t let you off; you owe us half a crown, recollect, and I must be\\r\\npaid to-night, so see and get the money somehow or other.\"  After a\\r\\nconsiderable pause he added, \"I answer for it he\\'d never miss half a\\r\\ncrown out of all that silver.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But to steal,\" said Lawrence, drawing back with horror, \"I never thought\\r\\nI should come to that--and from poor Jem, too--the money that he has\\r\\nworked so hard for, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is not stealing; we don\\'t mean to steal; only to borrow it; and\\r\\nif we win, which we certainly shall, at the cock-fight, pay it back\\r\\nagain, and he\\'ll never know anything about the matter, and what harm will\\r\\nit do him?  Besides, what signifies talking, you can\\'t go to the cock-\\r\\nfight, or the fair either, if you don\\'t; and I tell ye we don\\'t mean to\\r\\nsteal it; we\\'ll pay it by Monday night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLawrence made no reply, and they parted without his coming to any\\r\\ndetermination.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere let us pause in our story.  We are almost afraid to go on.  The rest\\r\\nis very shocking.  Our little readers will shudder as they read.  But it\\r\\nis better that they should know the truth, and see what the idle boy came\\r\\nto at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the dead of the night, Lawrence heard somebody tap at his window.  He\\r\\nknew well who it was, for this was the signal agreed upon between him and\\r\\nhis wicked companion.  He trembled at the thoughts of what he was about\\r\\nto do, and lay quite still, with his head under the bedclothes, till he\\r\\nheard the second tap.  Then he got up, dressed himself, and opened his\\r\\nwindow.  It was almost even with the ground.  His companion said to him,\\r\\nin a hollow voice, \"Are you ready?\"  He made no answer, but got out of\\r\\nthe window and followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he got to the stable a black cloud was just passing over the moon,\\r\\nand it was quite dark.  \"Where are you?\" whispered Lawrence, groping\\r\\nabout, \"where are you?  Speak to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am here; give me your hand.\"  Lawrence stretched out his hand.  \"Is\\r\\nthat your hand?\" said the wicked boy, as Lawrence laid hold of him; \"how\\r\\ncold it feels.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us go back,\" said Lawrence; \"it is time yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is no time to go back,\" replied the other, opening the door; \"you\\'ve\\r\\ngone too far now to go back,\" and he pushed Lawrence into the stable.\\r\\n\"Have you found it?  Take care of the horse.  Have you done?  What are\\r\\nyou about?  Make haste, I hear a noise,\" said the stable boy, who watched\\r\\nat the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am feeling for the half-crown, but I can\\'t find it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bring all together.\"  He brought Jem\\'s broken flower pot, with all the\\r\\nmoney in it, to the door.  The black cloud had now passed over the moon,\\r\\nand the light shone full upon them.  \"What do we stand here for?\" said\\r\\nthe stable boy, snatching the flower-pot out of Lawrence\\'s trembling\\r\\nhands, and pulled him away from the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good God!\" cried Lawrence, \"you won\\'t take all.  You said you\\'d only\\r\\ntake half a crown, and pay it back on Monday.  You said you\\'d only take\\r\\nhalf a crown!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hold your tongue,\" replied the other, walking on, deaf to all\\r\\nremonstrances--\"if ever I am to be hanged, it sha\\'n\\'t be for half a\\r\\ncrown.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLawrence\\'s blood ran cold in his veins, and he felt as if all his hair\\r\\nstood on end.  Not another word passed.  His accomplice carried off the\\r\\nmoney, and Lawrence crept, with all the horrors of guilt upon him, to his\\r\\nrestless bed.  All night he was starting from frightful dreams; or else,\\r\\nbroad awake, he lay listening to every small noise, unable to stir, and\\r\\nscarcely daring to breathe--tormented by that most dreadful of all kinds\\r\\nof fear, that fear which is the constant companion of an evil conscience.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought the morning would never come; but when it was day, when he\\r\\nheard the birds sing, and saw everything look cheerful as usual, he felt\\r\\nstill more miserable.  It was Sunday morning, and the bell rang for\\r\\nchurch.  All the children of the village, dressed in their Sunday\\r\\nclothes, innocent and gay, and little Jem, the best and gayest amongst\\r\\nthem, went flocking by his door to church.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Lawrence,\" said Jem, pulling his coat as he passed and saw\\r\\nLawrence leaning against his father\\'s door, \"what makes you look so\\r\\nblack?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I?\" said Lawrence, starting; \"why do you say that I look black?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, then,\" said Jem, \"you look white enough now, if that will please\\r\\nyou, for you\\'re turned as pale as death.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pale?\" replied Lawrence, not knowing what he said, and turned abruptly\\r\\naway, for he dared not stand another look of Jem\\'s; conscious that guilt\\r\\nwas written in his face, he shunned every eye.  He would now have given\\r\\nthe world to have thrown off the load of guilt which lay upon his mind.\\r\\nHe longed to follow Jem, to fall upon his knees and confess all.\\r\\n\\r\\nDreading the moment when Jem should discover his loss, Lawrence dared not\\r\\nstay at home, and not knowing what to do, or where to go, he mechanically\\r\\nwent to his old haunt at the stable yard, and lurked thereabouts all day\\r\\nwith his accomplice, who tried in vain to quiet his fears and raise his\\r\\nspirits by talking of the next day\\'s cock-fight.  It was agreed that as\\r\\nsoon as the dusk of the evening came on, they should go together into a\\r\\ncertain lonely field, and there divide their booty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, Jem, when he returned from church, was very full of\\r\\nbusiness, preparing for the reception of his mistress, of whose intended\\r\\nvisit he had informed his mother; and whilst she was arranging the\\r\\nkitchen and their little parlour, he ran to search the strawberry beds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, my Jem, how merry you are to-day!\" said his mother, when he came in\\r\\nwith the strawberries, and was jumping about the room playfully.  \"Now,\\r\\nkeep those spirits of yours, Jem, till you want \\'em, and don\\'t let it\\r\\ncome upon you all at once.  Have it in mind that to-morrow\\'s fair day,\\r\\nand Lightfoot must go.  I bid Farmer Truck call for him to-night.  He\\r\\nsaid he\\'d take him along with his own, and he\\'ll be here just now--and\\r\\nthen I know how it will be with you, Jem!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So do I!\" cried Jem, swallowing his secret with great difficulty, and\\r\\nthen tumbling head over heels four times running.\\r\\n\\r\\nA carriage passed the window, and stopped at the door.  Jem ran out; it\\r\\nwas his mistress.  She came in smiling, and soon made the old woman\\r\\nsmile, too, by praising the neatness of everything in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall pass over, however important as they were deemed at the time,\\r\\nthe praises of the strawberries, and of \"my grandmother\\'s china plate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother knock was heard at the door.  \"Run, Jem,\" said his mother.  \"I\\r\\nhope it\\'s our milk-woman with cream for the lady.\"  No; it was Farmer\\r\\nTruck come for Lightfoot.  The old woman\\'s countenance fell.  \"Fetch him\\r\\nout, dear,\" said she, turning to her son; but Jem was gone; he flew out\\r\\nto the stable the moment he saw the flap of Farmer Truck\\'s great-coat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sit ye down, farmer,\" said the old woman, after they had waited about\\r\\nfive minutes in expectation of Jem\\'s return.  \"You\\'d best sit down, if\\r\\nthe lady will give you leave; for he\\'ll not hurry himself back again.  My\\r\\nboy\\'s a fool, madam, about that there horse.\"  Trying to laugh, she\\r\\nadded, \"I knew how Lightfoot and he would be loath enough to part.  He\\r\\nwon\\'t bring him out till the last minute; so do sit ye down, neighbour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe farmer had scarcely sat down when Jem, with a pale, wild countenance\\r\\ncame back.  \"What\\'s the matter?\" said his mistress.  \"God bless the boy!\"\\r\\nsaid his mother, looking at him quite frightened, whilst he tried to\\r\\nspeak, but could not.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went up to him, and then leaning his head against her, he cried,\\r\\n\"It\\'s gone!--it\\'s all gone!\" and, bursting into tears, he sobbed as if\\r\\nhis little heart would break.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s gone, love?\" said his mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My two guineas--Lightfoot\\'s two guineas.  I went to fetch \\'em to give\\r\\nyou, mammy; but the broken flower-pot that I put them in, and all\\'s\\r\\ngone!--quite gone!\" repeated he, checking his sobs.  \"I saw them safe\\r\\nlast night, and was showing \\'em to Lightfoot; and I was so glad to think\\r\\nI had earned them all myself; and I thought how surprised you\\'d look, and\\r\\nhow glad you\\'d be, and how you\\'d kiss me, and all!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis mother listened to him with the greatest surprise, whilst his\\r\\nmistress stood in silence, looking first at the old woman, and then at\\r\\nJem with a penetrating eye, as if she suspected the truth of his story,\\r\\nand was afraid of becoming the dupe of her own compassion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a very strange thing!\" said she, gravely.  \"How came you to\\r\\nleave all your money in a broken flower-pot in the stable?  How came you\\r\\nnot to give it to your mother to take care of?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, don\\'t you remember?\" said Jem, looking up, in the midst of his\\r\\ntears--\"why, don\\'t you remember you, your own self, bid me not tell her\\r\\nabout it till you were by?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And did you not tell her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, ask mammy,\" said Jem, a little offended; and when afterwards the\\r\\nlady went on questioning him in a severe manner, as if she did not\\r\\nbelieve him, he at last made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Jem! Jem! why don\\'t you speak to the lady?\" said his mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have spoke, and spoke the truth,\" said Jem, proudly; \"and she did not\\r\\nbelieve me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill the lady, who had lived too long in the world to be without\\r\\nsuspicion, maintained a cold manner, and determined to wait the event\\r\\nwithout interfering, saying only, that she hoped the money would be\\r\\nfound, and advised Jem to have done crying.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have done,\" said Jem; \"I shall cry no more.\"  And as he had the\\r\\ngreatest command over himself, he actually did not shed another tear, not\\r\\neven when the farmer got up to go, saying, he could wait no longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nJem silently went to bring out Lightfoot.  The lady now took her seat,\\r\\nwhere she could see all that passed at the open parlour-window.  The old\\r\\nwoman stood at the door, and several idle people of the village, who had\\r\\ngathered round the lady\\'s carriage examining it, turned about to listen.\\r\\nIn a minute or two Jem appeared, with a steady countenance, leading\\r\\nLightfoot and, when he came up, without saying a word, put the bridle\\r\\ninto Farmer Truck\\'s hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He HAS BEEN a good horse,\" said the farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He IS a good horse!\" cried Jem, and threw his arm over Lightfoot\\'s neck,\\r\\nhiding his own face as he leaned upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant a party of milk-women went by; and one of them, having\\r\\nset down her pail, came behind Jem, and gave him a pretty smart blow upon\\r\\nthe back.  He looked up.  \"And don\\'t you know me?\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I forget,\" said Jem; \"I think I have seen your face before, but I\\r\\nforget.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you so? and you\\'ll tell me just now,\" said she, half opening her\\r\\nhand, \"that you forget who gave you this, and who charged you not to part\\r\\nwith it, too.\"  Here she quite opened her large hand, and on the palm of\\r\\nit appeared Jem\\'s silver penny.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where?\" exclaimed Jem, seizing it, \"oh, where did you find it? and have\\r\\nyou--oh, tell me, have you got the rest of my money?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know nothing of your money--I don\\'t know what you would be at,\" said\\r\\nthe milk-woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But where--pray tell me where--did you find this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With them that you gave it to, I suppose,\" said the milk-woman, turning\\r\\naway suddenly to take up her milk-pail.  But now Jem\\'s mistress called to\\r\\nher through the window, begging her to stop, and joining in his\\r\\nentreaties to know how she came by the silver penny.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, madam,\" said she, taking up the corner of her apron, \"I came by it\\r\\nin an odd way, too.  You must know my Betty is sick, so I came with the\\r\\nmilk myself, though it\\'s not what I\\'m used to; for my Betty--you know my\\r\\nBetty?\" said she, turning round to the old woman, \"my Betty serves you,\\r\\nand she\\'s a tight and stirring lassy, ma\\'am, I can assure--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I don\\'t doubt it,\" said the lady, impatiently; \"but about the\\r\\nsilver penny?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, that\\'s true; as I was coming along all alone, for the rest came\\r\\nround, and I came a short cut across yon field--no, you can\\'t see it,\\r\\nmadam, where you stand--but if you were here--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see it--I know it,\" said Jem, out of breath with anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well--well--I rested my pail upon the stile, and sets me down awhile,\\r\\nand there comes out of the hedge--I don\\'t know well how, for they\\r\\nstartled me so I\\'d liked to have thrown down my milk--two boys, one about\\r\\nthe size of he,\" said she pointing to Jem, \"and one a matter taller, but\\r\\nill-looking like; so I did not think to stir to make way for them, and\\r\\nthey were like in a desperate hurry:  so, without waiting for the stile,\\r\\none of \\'em pulled at the gate, and when it would not open (for it was\\r\\ntied with a pretty stout cord) one of \\'em whips out with his knife and\\r\\ncuts it--  Now, have you a knife about you, sir?\" continued the milk\\r\\nwoman to the farmer.  He gave her his knife.  \"Here, now, ma\\'am, just\\r\\nsticking, as it were here, between the blade and the haft, was the silver\\r\\npenny.  The lad took no notice; but when he opened it, out it falls.\\r\\nStill he takes no heed, but cuts the cord, as I said before, and through\\r\\nthe gate they went, and out of sight in half a minute.  I picks up the\\r\\npenny, for my heart misgave me that it was the very one husband had had a\\r\\nlong time, and had given against my voice to he,\" pointing to Jem; \"and I\\r\\ncharged him not to part with it; and, ma\\'am, when I looked I knew it by\\r\\nthe mark, so I thought I would show it to HE,\" again pointing to Jem,\\r\\n\"and let him give it back to those it belongs to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It belongs to me,\" said Jem, \"I never gave it to anybody--but--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" cried the farmer, \"those boys have robbed him; it is they who have\\r\\nall his money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, which way did they go?\" cried Jem, \"I\\'ll run after them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" said the lady, calling to her servant; and she desired him to\\r\\ntake his horse and ride after them.  \"Ay,\" added Farmer Truck, \"do you\\r\\ntake the road, and I\\'ll take the field way, and I\\'ll be bound we\\'ll have\\r\\n\\'em presently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst they were gone in pursuit of the thieves, the lady, who was now\\r\\nthoroughly convinced of Jem\\'s truth, desired her coachman would produce\\r\\nwhat she had ordered him to bring with him that evening.  Out of the boot\\r\\nof the carriage the coachman immediately produced a new saddle and\\r\\nbridle.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Jem\\'s eyes sparkled when the saddle was thrown upon Lightfoot\\'s back!\\r\\n\"Put it on your horse yourself, Jem,\" said the lady; \"it is yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nConfused reports of Lightfoot\\'s splendid accoutrements, of the pursuit of\\r\\nthieves, and of the fine and generous lady who was standing at Dame\\r\\nPreston\\'s window, quickly spread through the village, and drew everybody\\r\\nfrom their houses.  They crowded round Jem to hear the story.  The\\r\\nchildren especially, who were fond of him, expressed the strongest\\r\\nindignation against the thieves.  Every eye was on the stretch; and now\\r\\nsome, who had run down the lane, came back shouting, \"Here they are!\\r\\nthey\\'ve got the thieves!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe footman on horseback carried one boy before him; and the farmer,\\r\\nstriding along, dragged another.  The latter had on a red jacket, which\\r\\nlittle Jem immediately recollected, and scarcely dared lift his eyes to\\r\\nlook at the boy on horseback.  \"Good God!\" said he to himself, \"it must\\r\\nbe--yet surely it can\\'t be Lawrence!\"  The footman rode on as fast as the\\r\\npeople would let him.  The boy\\'s hat was slouched, and his head hung\\r\\ndown, so that nobody could see his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant there was a disturbance in the crowd.  A man who was half\\r\\ndrunk pushed his way forwards, swearing that nobody should stop him; that\\r\\nhe had a right to see--and he WOULD see.  And so he did; for, forcing\\r\\nthrough all resistance, he staggered up to the footman just as he was\\r\\nlifting down the boy he had carried before him.  \"I WILL--I tell you I\\r\\nWILL see the thief!\" cried the drunken man, pushing up the boy\\'s hat.  It\\r\\nwas his own son.  \"Lawrence!\" exclaimed the wretched father.  The shock\\r\\nsobered him at once, and he hid his face in his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an awful silence.  Lawrence fell on his knees, and in a voice\\r\\nthat could scarcely be heard made a full confession of all the\\r\\ncircumstances of his guilt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such a young creature so wicked!\" the bystanders exclaimed; \"what could\\r\\nput such wickedness in your head?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bad company,\" said Lawrence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how came you--what brought you into bad company?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know, except it was idleness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this was saying the farmer was emptying Lazy Lawrence\\'s pockets;\\r\\nand when the money appeared, all his former companions in the village\\r\\nlooked at each other with astonishment and terror.  Their parents grasped\\r\\ntheir little hands closer, and cried, \"Thank God! he is not my son.  How\\r\\noften when he was little we used, as he lounged about, to tell him that\\r\\nidleness was the root of all evil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the hardened wretch, his accomplice, everyone was impatient to\\r\\nhave him sent to gaol.  He put on a bold, insolent countenance, till he\\r\\nheard Lawrence\\'s confession; till the money was found upon him; and he\\r\\nheard the milk-woman declare that she would swear to the silver penny\\r\\nwhich he had dropped.  Then he turned pale, and betrayed the strongest\\r\\nsigns of fear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must take him before the justice,\" said the farmer, \"and he\\'ll be\\r\\nlodged in Bristol gaol.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" said Jem, springing forwards when Lawrence\\'s hands were going to be\\r\\ntied, \"let him go--won\\'t you?--can\\'t you let him go?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, madam, for mercy\\'s sake,\" said Jem\\'s mother to the lady, \"think\\r\\nwhat a disgrace to his family to be sent to gaol.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis father stood by wringing his hands in an agony of despair.  \"It\\'s all\\r\\nmy fault,\" cried he; \"I brought him up in idleness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he\\'ll never be idle any more,\" said Jem; \"won\\'t you speak for him,\\r\\nma\\'am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t ask the lady to speak for him,\" said the farmer; \"it\\'s better he\\r\\nshould go to Bridewell now, than to the gallows by-and-by.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing more was said; for everybody felt the truth of the farmer\\'s\\r\\nspeech.\\r\\n\\r\\nLawrence was eventually sent to Bridewell for a month, and the stable-boy\\r\\nwas sent for trial, convicted, and transported to Botany Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Lawrence\\'s confinement, Jem often visited him, and carried him\\r\\nsuch little presents as he could afford to give; and Jem could afford to\\r\\nbe GENEROUS, because he was INDUSTRIOUS.  Lawrence\\'s heart was touched by\\r\\nhis kindness, and his example struck him so forcibly that, when his\\r\\nconfinement was ended, he resolved to set immediately to work; and, to\\r\\nthe astonishment of all who knew him, soon became remarkable for\\r\\nindustry.  He was found early and late at his work, established a new\\r\\ncharacter, and for ever lost the name of \"Lazy Lawrence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FALSE KEY.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Spencer, a very benevolent and sensible man, undertook the education\\r\\nof several poor children.  Among the rest was a boy of the name of\\r\\nFranklin, whom he had bred up from the time he was five years old.\\r\\nFranklin had the misfortune to be the son of a man of infamous character;\\r\\nand for many years this was a disgrace and reproach to his child.  When\\r\\nany of the neighbours\\' children quarrelled with him, they used to tell\\r\\nhim that he would turn out like his father.  But Mr. Spencer always\\r\\nassured him that he might make himself whatever he pleased; that by\\r\\nbehaving well he would certainly, sooner or later, secure the esteem and\\r\\nlove of all who knew him, even of those who had the strongest prejudice\\r\\nagainst him on his father\\'s account.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis hope was very delightful to Franklin, and he showed the strongest\\r\\ndesire to learn and to do everything that was right; so that Mr. Spencer\\r\\nsoon grew fond of him, and took great pains to instruct him, and to give\\r\\nhim all the good habits and principles which might make him a useful,\\r\\nrespectable and happy man.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he was about thirteen years of age, Mr. Spencer one day sent for him\\r\\ninto his closet; and as he was folding up a letter which he had been\\r\\nwriting, said to him, with a very kind look, but in a graver tone than\\r\\nusual, \"Franklin, you are going to leave me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir!\" said Franklin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are now going to leave me, and to begin the world for yourself.  You\\r\\nwill carry this letter to my sister, Mrs. Churchill, in Queen\\'s Square.\\r\\nYou know Queen\\'s Square?\"  Franklin bowed.  \"You must expect,\" continued\\r\\nMr. Spencer, \"to meet with several disagreeable things, and a great deal\\r\\nof rough work, at your first setting out; but be faithful and obedient to\\r\\nyour mistress, and obliging to your fellow-servants, and all will go\\r\\nwell.  Mrs. Churchill will make you a very good mistress, if you behave\\r\\nproperly; and I have no doubt but you will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you will always--I mean, as long as you deserve it--find a friend in\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, sir--I am sure you are--\"  There Franklin stopped short, for\\r\\nthe recollection of all Mr. Spencer\\'s goodness rushed upon him at once,\\r\\nand he could not say another word.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bring me a candle to seal this letter,\" said his master; and he was very\\r\\nglad to get out of the room.  He came back with the candle, and, with a\\r\\nstout heart, stood by whilst the letter was sealing; and, when his master\\r\\nput it into his hand, said, in a cheerful voice, \"I hope you will let me\\r\\nsee you again, sir, sometimes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly; whenever your mistress can spare you, I shall be very glad to\\r\\nsee you; and remember, if ever you get into any difficulty, don\\'t be\\r\\nafraid to come to me.  I have sometimes spoken harshly to you; but you\\r\\nwill not meet with a more indulgent friend.\"  Franklin at this turned\\r\\naway with a full heart; and, after making two or three attempts to\\r\\nexpress his gratitude, left the room without being able to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got to Queen\\'s Square about three o\\'clock.  The door was opened by a\\r\\nlarge, red-faced man, in a blue coat and scarlet waistcoat, to whom he\\r\\nfelt afraid to give his message, lest he should not be a servant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what\\'s your business, sir?\" said the butler.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a letter for Mrs. Churchill, sir,\" said Franklin, endeavouring to\\r\\npronounce his \"sir\" in a tone as respectful as the butler\\'s was insolent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man having examined the direction, seal, and edges of the letter,\\r\\ncarried it upstairs, and in a few minutes returned, and ordered Franklin\\r\\nto rub his shoes well and follow him.  He was then shown into a handsome\\r\\nroom, where he found his mistress--an elderly lady.  She asked him a few\\r\\nquestions, examining him attentively as she spoke; and her severe eye at\\r\\nfirst, and her gracious smile afterwards, made him feel that she was a\\r\\nperson to be both loved and feared.  \"I shall give you in charge,\" said\\r\\nshe, ringing a bell, \"to my housekeeper, and I hope she will have no\\r\\nreason to be displeased with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe housekeeper, when she first came in, appeared with a smiling\\r\\ncountenance; but the moment she cast her eyes on Franklin, it changed to\\r\\na look of surprise and suspicion.  Her mistress recommended him to her\\r\\nprotection, saying, \"Pomfret, I hope you will keep this boy under your\\r\\nown eye.\"  And she received him with a cold \"Very well, ma\\'am,\" which\\r\\nplainly showed that she was not disposed to like him.  In fact, Mrs.\\r\\nPomfret was a woman so fond of power, and so jealous of favour, that she\\r\\nwould have quarrelled with an angel who had got so near her mistress\\r\\nwithout her introduction.  She smothered her displeasure, however, till\\r\\nnight; when, as she attended her mistress\\' toilette, she could not\\r\\nrefrain from expressing her sentiments.  She began cautiously:  \"Ma\\'am,\\r\\nis not this the boy Mr. Spencer was talking of one day--that has been\\r\\nbrought up by the VILLAINTROPIC SOCIETY, I think they call it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Philanthropic Society; yes,\" said her mistress; \"and my brother gives\\r\\nhim a high character:  I hope he will do very well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sure I hope so too,\" observed Mrs. Pomfret; \"but I can\\'t say; for my\\r\\npart, I\\'ve no great notion of those low people.  They say all those\\r\\nchildren are taken from the very lowest DRUGS and REFUGES of the town,\\r\\nand surely they are like enough, ma\\'am, to take after their own fathers\\r\\nand mothers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But they are not suffered to be with their parents,\" rejoined the lady;\\r\\n\"and therefore cannot be hurt by their example.  This little boy, to be\\r\\nsure, was unfortunate in his father, but he has had an excellent\\r\\neducation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, EDICATION! to be sure, ma\\'am, I know.  I don\\'t say but what\\r\\nedication is a great thing.  But then, ma\\'am, edication can\\'t change the\\r\\nNATUR that\\'s in one, they say; and one\\'s that born naturally bad and low,\\r\\nthey say, all the edication in the world won\\'t do no good; and, for my\\r\\npart, ma\\'am, I know you knows best; but I should be afraid to let any of\\r\\nthose Villaintropic folks get into my house; for nobody can tell the\\r\\nnatur of them aforehand.  I declare it frights me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pomfret, I thought you had better sense:  how would this poor boy earn\\r\\nhis bread? he would be forced to starve or steal, if everybody had such\\r\\nprejudices.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPomfret, who really was a good woman, was softened at this idea, and\\r\\nsaid, \"God forbid he should starve or steal, and God forbid I should say\\r\\nanything PREJUDICIARY of the boy; for there may be no harm in him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Churchill, changing her tone, \"but, Pomfret, if we\\r\\ndon\\'t like the boy at the end of the month, we have done with him; for I\\r\\nhave only promised Mr. Spencer to keep him a month upon trial:  there is\\r\\nno harm done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear, no, ma\\'am, to be sure; and cook must put up with her\\r\\ndisappointment, that\\'s all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What disappointment?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About her nephew, ma\\'am; the boy she and I was speaking to you for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The day you called her up about the almond pudding, ma\\'am.  If you\\r\\nremember, you said you should have no objections to try the boy; and upon\\r\\nthat cook bought him new shirts; but they are to the good, as I tell\\r\\nher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I did not promise to take her nephew.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O, no ma\\'am, not at all; she does not think to SAY THAT, else I should\\r\\nbe very angry; but the poor woman never let fall a word, any more than\\r\\nfrets that the boy should miss such a good place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, but since I did say that I should have no objection to try him, I\\r\\nshall keep my word; let him come to-morrow.  Let them both have a fair\\r\\ntrial, and at the end of the month I can decide which I like best, and\\r\\nwhich we had better keep.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDismissed with these orders, Mrs. Pomfret hastened to report all that had\\r\\npassed to the cook, like a favourite minister, proud to display the\\r\\nextent of her secret influence.  In the morning Felix, the cook\\'s nephew,\\r\\narrived; and, the moment he came into the kitchen, every eye, even the\\r\\nscullion\\'s, was fixed upon him with approbation, and afterwards glanced\\r\\nupon Franklin with contempt--contempt which Franklin could not endure\\r\\nwithout some confusion, though quite unconscious of having deserved it;\\r\\nnor, upon the most impartial and cool self-examination, could he\\r\\ncomprehend the justice of his judges.  He perceived indeed--for the\\r\\ncomparisons were minutely made in audible and scornful whispers--that\\r\\nFelix was a much handsomer, or as the kitchen maid expressed it, a much\\r\\nmore genteeler gentlemanly looking like sort of person than he was; and\\r\\nhe was made to understand, that he wanted a frill to his shirt, a cravat,\\r\\na pair of thin shoes, and, above all, shoe strings, besides other\\r\\nnameless advantages, which justly made his rival the admiration of the\\r\\nkitchen.  However, upon calling to mind all that his friend Mr. Spencer\\r\\nhad ever said to him, he could not recollect his having warned him that\\r\\nshoe strings were indispensable requisites to the character of a good\\r\\nservant; so that he could only comfort himself with resolving, if\\r\\npossible, to make amends for these deficiencies, and to dissipate the\\r\\nprejudices which he saw were formed against him, by the strictest\\r\\nadherence to all that his tutor had taught him to be his duty.  He hoped\\r\\nto secure the approbation of his mistress by scrupulous obedience to all\\r\\nher commands, and faithful care of all that belonged to her.  At the same\\r\\ntime he flattered himself he should win the goodwill of his fellow\\r\\nservants by showing a constant desire to oblige them.  He pursued this\\r\\nplan of conduct steadily for nearly three weeks, and found that he\\r\\nsucceeded beyond his expectations in pleasing his mistress; but\\r\\nunfortunately he found it more difficult to please his fellow servants,\\r\\nand he sometimes offended when he least expected it.  He had made great\\r\\nprogress in the affections of Corkscrew, the butler, by working indeed\\r\\nvery hard for him, and doing every day at least half his business.  But\\r\\none unfortunate night the butler was gone out; the bell rang:  he went\\r\\nupstairs; and his mistress asking where Corkscrew was, he answered that\\r\\nhe was gone out.  \"Where to!\" said his mistress.  \"I don\\'t know,\"\\r\\nanswered Franklin.  And, as he had told exactly the truth, and meant to\\r\\ndo no harm, he was surprised, at the butler\\'s return, when he repeated to\\r\\nhim what had passed, at receiving a sudden box on the ear, and the\\r\\nappellation of a mischievous, impertinent, mean-spirited brat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mischievous, impertinent, mean!\" repeated Franklin to himself; but,\\r\\nlooking in the butler\\'s face, which was a deeper scarlet than usual, he\\r\\njudged that he was far from sober, and did not doubt but that the next\\r\\nmorning, when he came to the use of his reason, he would be sensible of\\r\\nhis injustice, and apologize for his box of the ear.  But no apology\\r\\ncoming all day, Franklin at last ventured to request an explanation, or\\r\\nrather, to ask what he had best do on the next occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" said Corkscrew, \"when mistress asked for me, how came you to say I\\r\\nwas gone out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because, you know, I saw you go out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And when she asked you where I was gone, how came you to say that you\\r\\ndid not know?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because, indeed, I did not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a stupid blockhead! could you not say I was gone to the\\r\\nwasherwoman\\'s?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But WERE you?\" said Franklin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was I?\" cried Corkscrew, and looked as if he would have struck him\\r\\nagain; \"how dare you give me the lie, Mr. Hypocrite?  You would be ready\\r\\nenough, I\\'ll be bound, to make excuses for yourself.  Why are not\\r\\nmistress\\' clogs cleaned?  Go along and blacken \\'em, this minute, and send\\r\\nFelix to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this time forward Felix alone was privileged to enter the butler\\'s\\r\\npantry.  Felix became the favourite of Corkscrew; and, though Franklin by\\r\\nno means sought to pry into the mysteries of their private conferences,\\r\\nnor ever entered without knocking at the door, yet it was his fate once\\r\\nto be sent of a message at an unlucky time; and, as the door was half\\r\\nopen, he could not avoid seeing Felix drinking a bumper of red liquor,\\r\\nwhich he could not help suspecting to be wine; and, as the decanter,\\r\\nwhich usually went upstairs after dinner, was at this time in the\\r\\nbutler\\'s grasp, without any stopper in it, he was involuntarily forced to\\r\\nsuspect they were drinking his mistress\\' wine.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor were the bumpers of port the only unlawful rewards which Felix\\r\\nreceived:  his aunt, the cook, had occasion for his assistance, and she\\r\\nhad many delicious douceurs in her gift.  Many a handful of currants,\\r\\nmany a half-custard, many a triangular remnant of pie, besides the choice\\r\\nof his own meal at breakfast, dinner and supper, fell to the share of the\\r\\nfavourite Felix; whilst Franklin was neglected, though he took the utmost\\r\\npains to please the cook in all honourable service, and, when she was\\r\\nhot, angry, or hurried, he was always at hand to help her; and in the\\r\\nhour of adversity, when the clock struck five, and no dinner was dished,\\r\\nand no kitchen maid with twenty pair of hands was to be had, Franklin\\r\\nwould answer to her call, with flowers to garnish her dishes, and\\r\\npresence of mind to know, in the midst of the commotion, where everything\\r\\nthat was wanting was to be found; so that, quick as lightning, all\\r\\ndifficulties vanished before him.  Yet when the danger was over, and the\\r\\nhour of adversity had past, the ungrateful cook would forget her\\r\\nbenefactor, and, when it came to his supper time, would throw him, with a\\r\\ncarelessness that touched him sensibly, anything which the other servants\\r\\nwere too nice to eat.  All this Franklin bore with fortitude; nor did he\\r\\nenvy Felix the dainties which he ate, sometimes close beside him:  \"For,\"\\r\\nsaid he to himself, \"I have a clear conscience, and that is more than\\r\\nFelix can have.  I know how he wins cook\\'s favour too well, and I fancy I\\r\\nknow how I have offended her; for since the day I saw the basket, she has\\r\\ndone nothing but huff me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of the basket was this.  Mrs. Pomfret, the housekeeper, had\\r\\nseveral times, directly and indirectly, given the world below to\\r\\nunderstand that she and her mistress thought there was a prodigious\\r\\nquantity of meat eaten of late.  Now, when she spoke, it was usually at\\r\\ndinner time; she always looked, or Franklin imagined that she looked,\\r\\nsuspiciously at him.  Other people looked more maliciously; but, as he\\r\\nfelt himself perfectly innocent, he went on eating his dinner in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at length it was time to explain.  One Sunday there appeared a\\r\\nhandsome sirloin of beef, which before noon on Monday had shrunk almost\\r\\nto the bare bone, and presented such a deplorable spectacle to the\\r\\nopening eyes of Mrs. Pomfret that her long smothered indignation burst\\r\\nforth, and she boldly declared she was now certain there had been foul\\r\\nplay, and she would have the beef found, or she would know why.  She\\r\\nspoke, but no beef appeared, till Franklin, with a look of sudden\\r\\nrecollection, cried, \"Did not I see something like a piece of beef in a\\r\\nbasket in the dairy?--I think--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cook, as if somebody had smote her a deadly blow, grew pale; but,\\r\\nsuddenly recovering the use of her speech, turned upon Franklin, and,\\r\\nwith a voice of thunder, gave him the lie direct; and forthwith, taking\\r\\nMrs. Pomfret by the ruffle, led the way to the dairy, declaring she could\\r\\ndefy the world--\"that so she could, and would.\"  \"There, ma\\'am,\" said she\\r\\nkicking an empty basket which lay on the floor--\"there\\'s malice for you.\\r\\nAsk him why he don\\'t show you the beef in the basket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought I saw--\" poor Franklin began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You thought you saw!\" cried the cook, coming close up to him with\\r\\nkimboed arms, and looking like a dragon; \"and pray, sir, what business\\r\\nhas such a one as you to think you see?  And pray, ma\\'am, will you be\\r\\npleased to speak--perhaps, ma\\'am, he\\'ll condescend to obey you--ma\\'am,\\r\\nwill you be pleased to forbid him my dairy? for here he comes prying and\\r\\nspying about; and how, ma\\'am, am I to answer for my butter and cream, or\\r\\nanything at all?  I\\'m sure it\\'s what I can\\'t pretend to, unless you do me\\r\\nthe justice to forbid him my places.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Pomfret, whose eyes were blinded by her prejudices against the folks\\r\\nof the \"Villaintropic Society,\" and also by her secret jealousy of a boy\\r\\nwhom she deemed to be a growing favourite of her mistress\\', took part\\r\\nwith the cook, and ended, as she began, with a firm persuasion that\\r\\nFranklin was the guilty person.  \"Let him alone, let him alone!\" said\\r\\nshe; \"he has as many turns and windings as a hare; but we shall catch him\\r\\nyet, I\\'ll be bound, in some of his doublings.  I knew the nature of him\\r\\nwell enough, from the first time I ever set my eyes upon him; but\\r\\nmistress shall have her own way, and see the end of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words, and the bitter sense of injustice, drew tears at length fast\\r\\ndown the proud cheek of Franklin, which might possibly have touched Mrs.\\r\\nPomfret, if Felix, with a sneer, had not called them CROCODILE TEARS.\\r\\n\"Felix, too!\" thought he; \"this is too much.\"  In fact, Felix had till\\r\\nnow professed himself his firm ally, and had on his part received from\\r\\nFranklin unequivocal proofs of friendship; for it must be told that every\\r\\nother morning, when it was Felix\\'s turn to get breakfast, Felix never was\\r\\nup in decent time, and must inevitably have come to public disgrace if\\r\\nFranklin had not got all the breakfast things ready for him, the bread\\r\\nand butter spread, and the toast toasted; and had not, moreover,\\r\\nregularly, when the clock struck eight, and Mrs. Pomfret\\'s foot was heard\\r\\noverhead, run to call the sleeping Felix, and helped him constantly\\r\\nthrough the hurry of getting dressed one instant before the housekeeper\\r\\ncame downstairs.  All this could not but be present to his memory; but,\\r\\nseeming to reproach him, Franklin wiped away his crocodile tears, and\\r\\npreserved a magnanimous silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hour of retribution was, however, not so far off as Felix imagined.\\r\\nCunning people may go on cleverly in their devices for some time; but\\r\\nalthough they may escape once, twice, perhaps ninety-nine times, what\\r\\ndoes that signify?--for the hundredth time they come to shame, and lose\\r\\nall their character.  Grown bold by frequent success, Felix became more\\r\\ncareless in his operations; and it happened that one day he met his\\r\\nmistress full in the passage, as he was going on one of the cook\\'s secret\\r\\nerrands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where are you going, Felix?\" said his mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To the washerwoman\\'s, ma\\'am,\" answered he, with his usual effrontery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well,\" said she.  \"Call at the bookseller\\'s in--stay, I must write\\r\\ndown the direction.  Pomfret,\" said she, opening the housekeeper\\'s room\\r\\ndoor, \"have you a bit of paper?\"  Pomfret came with the writing-paper,\\r\\nand looked very angry to see that Felix was going out without her\\r\\nknowledge; so, while Mrs. Churchill was writing the direction, she stood\\r\\ntalking to him about it; whilst he, in the greatest terror imaginable,\\r\\nlooked up in her face as she spoke; but was all the time intent on\\r\\nparrying on the other side the attacks of a little French dog of his\\r\\nmistress\\', which, unluckily for him, had followed her into the passage.\\r\\nManchon was extremely fond of Felix, who, by way of pleasing his\\r\\nmistress, had paid most assiduous court to her dog; yet now his caresses\\r\\nwere rather troublesome.  Manchon leaped up, and was not to be rebuffed.\\r\\n\"Poor fellow--poor fellow--down! down!  poor fellow!\" cried Felix, and\\r\\nput him away.  But Manchon leaped up again, and began smelling near the\\r\\nfatal pocket in a most alarming manner.  \"You will see by this direction\\r\\nwhere you are to go,\" said his mistress.  \"Manchon, come here--and you\\r\\nwill be so good as to bring me--down! down! Manchon, be quiet!\"  But\\r\\nManchon knew better--he had now got his head into Felix\\'s pocket, and\\r\\nwould not be quiet till he had drawn from thence, rustling out of its\\r\\nbrown paper, half a cold turkey, which had been missing since morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My cold turkey, as I\\'m alive!\" exclaimed the housekeeper, darting upon\\r\\nit with horror and amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is all this?\" said Mrs. Churchill, in a composed voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know, ma\\'am,\" answered Felix, so confused that he knew not what\\r\\nto say; \"but--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what?\" cried Mrs. Pomfret, indignation flashing from her eyes.  \"But\\r\\nwhat?\" repeated his mistress, waiting for his reply with a calm air of\\r\\nattention, which still more disconcerted Felix; for, though with an angry\\r\\nperson he might have some chance of escape, he knew that he could not\\r\\ninvent any excuse in such circumstances, which could stand the\\r\\nexamination of a person in her sober senses.  He was struck dumb.\\r\\n\"Speak,\" said Mrs. Churchill, in a still lower tone; \"I am ready to hear\\r\\nall you have to say.  In my house everybody shall have justice; speak--\\r\\nbut what?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"BUT,\" stammered Felix; and, after in vain attempting to equivocate,\\r\\nconfessed that he was going to take the turkey to his cousin\\'s; but he\\r\\nthrew all the blame upon his aunt, the cook, who, he said, had ordered\\r\\nhim upon this expedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cook was now summoned; but she totally denied all knowledge of the\\r\\naffair, with the same violence with which she had lately confounded\\r\\nFranklin about the beef in the basket; not entirely, however, with the\\r\\nsame success; for Felix, perceiving by his mistress\\' eye that she was on\\r\\nthe point of desiring him to leave the house immediately; and not being\\r\\nvery willing to leave a place in which he had lived so well with the\\r\\nbutler, did not hesitate to confront his aunt with assurance equal to her\\r\\nown.  He knew how to bring his charge home to her.  He produced a note in\\r\\nher own handwriting, the purport of which was to request her cousin\\'s\\r\\nacceptance of \"some DELICATE COLD TURKEY,\" and to beg she would send her,\\r\\nby the return of the bearer, a little of her cherry-brandy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Churchill coolly wrote upon the back of the note her cook\\'s\\r\\ndischarge, and informed Felix she had no further occasion for his\\r\\nservices, but, upon his pleading with many tears, which Franklin did not\\r\\ncall CROCODILE TEARS, that he was so young, that he was under the\\r\\ndominion of his aunt, he touched Mrs. Pomfret\\'s compassion, and she\\r\\nobtained for him permission to stay till the end of the month, to give\\r\\nhim yet a chance of redeeming his character.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Pomfret now seeing how far she had been imposed upon, resolved, for\\r\\nthe future, to be more upon her guard with Felix, and felt that she had\\r\\ntreated Franklin with great injustice, when she accused him of\\r\\nmalpractices about the sirloin of beef.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood people, when they are made sensible that they have treated anyone\\r\\nwith injustice, are impatient to have an opportunity to rectify their\\r\\nmistake; and Mrs. Pomfret was now prepared to see everything which\\r\\nFranklin did in the most favourable point of view; especially as the next\\r\\nday she discovered that it was he who every morning boiled the water for\\r\\nher tea, and buttered her toast--services for which she had always\\r\\nthought she was indebted to Felix.  Besides, she had rated Felix\\'s\\r\\nabilities very highly, because he made up her weekly accounts for her;\\r\\nbut unluckily once, when Franklin was out of the way, and she brought a\\r\\nbill in a hurry to her favourite to cast up, she discovered that he did\\r\\nnot know how to cast up pounds, shillings and pence, and he was obliged\\r\\nto confess that she must wait till Franklin came home.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, passing over a number of small incidents which gradually unfolded\\r\\nthe character of the two boys, we must proceed to a more serious affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorkscrew frequently, after he had finished taking away supper, and after\\r\\nthe housekeeper was gone to bed, sallied forth to a neighbouring alehouse\\r\\nto drink with his friends.  The alehouse was kept by that cousin of\\r\\nFelix\\'s, who was so fond of \"DELICATE cold turkey,\" and who had such\\r\\nchoice cherry-brandy.  Corkscrew kept the key of the house door, so that\\r\\nhe could return home whenever he thought proper; and, if he should by\\r\\naccident be called for by his mistress after supper, Felix knew where to\\r\\nfind him, and did not scruple to make any of those excuses which poor\\r\\nFranklin had too much integrity to use.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these precautions taken, the butler was at liberty to indulge his\\r\\nfavourite passion, which so increased with indulgence, that his wages\\r\\nwere by no means sufficient to support him in this way of life.  Every\\r\\nday he felt less resolution to break through his bad habits; for every\\r\\nday drinking became more necessary to him.  His health was ruined.  With\\r\\na red, pimpled, bloated face, emaciated legs, and a swelled, diseased\\r\\nbody, he appeared the victim of intoxication.  In the morning, when he\\r\\ngot up, his hands trembled, his spirits flagged, he could do nothing\\r\\nuntil he had taken a dram--an operation which he was obliged to repeat\\r\\nseveral times in the course of the day, as all those wretched people MUST\\r\\nwho once acquire this habit.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had run up a long bill at the alehouse which he frequented; and the\\r\\nlandlord, who grew urgent for his money, refused to give further credit.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night, when Corkscrew had drunk enough only to make him fretful, he\\r\\nleaned with his elbow surlily upon the table, began to quarrel with the\\r\\nlandlord, and swore that he had not of late treated him like a gentleman.\\r\\nTo which the landlord coolly replied, \"That as long as he had paid like a\\r\\ngentleman, he had been treated like one, and that was as much as anyone\\r\\ncould expect, or, at any rate, as much as anyone would meet with in this\\r\\nworld.\"  For the truth of this assertion he appealed, laughing, to a\\r\\nparty of men who were drinking in the room.  The men, however, took part\\r\\nwith Corkscrew, and, drawing him over to their table, made him sit down\\r\\nwith them.  They were in high good-humour, and the butler soon grew so\\r\\nintimate with them, that, in the openness of his heart, he soon\\r\\ncommunicated to them, not only all his own affairs, but all that he knew,\\r\\nand more than all that he knew, of his mistress\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis new friends were by no means uninterested by his conversation, and\\r\\nencouraged him as much as possible to talk; for they had secret views,\\r\\nwhich the butler was by no means sufficiently sober to discover.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Churchill had some fine old family plate; and these men belonged to\\r\\na gang of housebreakers.  Before they parted with Corkscrew, they engaged\\r\\nhim to meet them again the next night; their intimacy was still more\\r\\nclosely cemented.  One of the men actually offered to lend Corkscrew\\r\\nthree guineas towards the payment of his debt, and hinted that, if he\\r\\nthought proper, he could easily get the whole cleared off.  Upon this\\r\\nhint, Corkscrew became all attention, till, after some hesitation on\\r\\ntheir part, and repeated promises of secrecy on his, they at length\\r\\ndisclosed their plans to him.  They gave him to understand, that if he\\r\\nwould assist in letting them into his mistress\\' house, they would let him\\r\\nhave an ample share in the booty.  The butler, who had the reputation of\\r\\nbeing an honest man, and indeed whose integrity had hitherto been proof\\r\\nagainst everything but his mistress\\' port, turned pale, and trembled at\\r\\nthis proposal; drank two or three bumpers to drown thought; and promised\\r\\nto give an answer the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went home more than half-intoxicated.  His mind was so full of what\\r\\nhad passed, that he could not help bragging to Felix, whom he found awake\\r\\nat his return, that he could have his bill paid off at the alehouse\\r\\nwhenever he pleased; dropping, besides, some hints, which were not lost\\r\\nupon Felix.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning Felix reminded him of the things which he had said; and\\r\\nCorkscrew, alarmed, endeavoured to evade his questions, by saying that he\\r\\nwas not in his senses when he talked in that manner.  Nothing, however,\\r\\nthat he could urge made any impression upon Felix, whose recollection on\\r\\nthe subject was perfectly distinct, and who had too much cunning himself,\\r\\nand too little confidence in his companion, to be the dupe of his\\r\\ndissimulation.  The butler knew not what to do when he saw that Felix was\\r\\nabsolutely determined either to betray their scheme, or to become a\\r\\nsharer in the booty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next night came, and he was now to make a final decision; either to\\r\\ndetermine on breaking off entirely with his new acquaintances, or taking\\r\\nFelix with him to join in the plot.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis debt, his love of drinking, the impossibility of indulging it without\\r\\na fresh supply of money, all came into his mind at once, and conquered\\r\\nhis remaining scruples.  It is said by those whose fatal experience gives\\r\\nthem a right to be believed, that a drunkard will sacrifice anything,\\r\\neverything, sooner than the pleasure of habitual intoxication.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much easier is it never to begin a bad custom than to break through\\r\\nit when once formed!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hour of rendezvous came, and Corkscrew went to the alehouse, where he\\r\\nfound the housebreakers waiting for him, and a glass of brandy ready\\r\\npoured out.  He sighed--drank--hesitated--drank again--heard the landlord\\r\\ntalk of his bill, saw the money produced which would pay it in a moment--\\r\\ndrank again--cursed himself, and, giving his hand to the villain who was\\r\\nwhispering in his ear, swore that he could not help it, and must do as\\r\\nthey would have him.  They required of him to give up the key of the\\r\\nhouse door, that they might get another made by it.  He had left it with\\r\\nFelix, and was now obliged to explain the new difficulty which had\\r\\narisen.  Felix knew enough to ruin them, and must therefore be won over.\\r\\nThis was no very difficult task; he had a strong desire to have some\\r\\nworked cravats, and the butler knew enough of him to believe that this\\r\\nwould be a sufficient bribe.  The cravats were bought and shown to Felix.\\r\\nHe thought them the only things wanting to make him a complete, fine\\r\\ngentleman; and to go without them, especially when he had once seen\\r\\nhimself in the glass with one tied on in a splendid bow, appeared\\r\\nimpossible.  Even this paltry temptation, working upon his vanity, at\\r\\nlength prevailed with a boy whose integrity had long been corrupted by\\r\\nthe habits of petty pilfering and daily falsehood.  It was agreed that,\\r\\nthe first time his mistress sent him out on a message, he should carry\\r\\nthe key of the house door to his cousin\\'s, and deliver it into the hands\\r\\nof one of the gang, who were there in waiting for it.  Such was the\\r\\nscheme.\\r\\n\\r\\nFelix, the night after all this had been planned, went to bed, and fell\\r\\nfast asleep; but the butler, who had not yet stifled the voice of\\r\\nconscience, felt, in the silence of the night, so insupportably\\r\\nmiserable, that, instead of going to rest, he stole softly into the\\r\\npantry for a bottle of his mistress\\' wine, and there drinking glass after\\r\\nglass, he stayed till he became so far intoxicated, that, though he\\r\\ncontrived to find his way back to bed, he could by no means undress\\r\\nhimself.  Without any power of recollection, he flung himself upon the\\r\\nbed, leaving his candle half hanging out of the candlestick beside him.\\r\\nFranklin slept in the next room to him, and presently awaking, thought he\\r\\nperceived a strong smell of something burning.  He jumped up, and seeing\\r\\na light under the butler\\'s door, gently opened it, and to his\\r\\nastonishment, beheld one of the bed curtains in flames.  He immediately\\r\\nran to the butler, and pulled him with all his force, to rouse him from\\r\\nhis lethargy.  He came to his senses at length, but was so terrified, and\\r\\nso helpless, that, if it had not been for Franklin, the whole house would\\r\\nsoon inevitably have been on fire.  Felix, trembling and cowardly, knew\\r\\nnot what to do; and it was curious to see him obeying Franklin, whose\\r\\nturn it now was to command.  Franklin ran upstairs to awaken Mrs.\\r\\nPomfret, whose terror of fire was so great that she came from her room\\r\\nalmost out of her senses, whilst he, with the greatest presence of mind,\\r\\nrecollected where he had seen two large tubs of water, which the maids\\r\\nhad prepared the night before for their washing, and seizing the wet\\r\\nlinen which had been left to soak, he threw them upon the flames.  He\\r\\nexerted himself with so much good sense, that the fire was presently\\r\\nextinguished.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything was now once more safe and quiet.  Mrs. Pomfret, recovering\\r\\nfrom her fright, postponed all inquiries till the morning, and rejoiced\\r\\nthat her mistress had not been awakened, whilst Corkscrew flattered\\r\\nhimself that he should be able to conceal the true cause of the accident.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you tell Mrs. Pomfret where you found the candle when you came\\r\\ninto the room,\" said he to Franklin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If she asks me, you know I must tell the truth,\" replied he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Must!\" repeated Felix, sneeringly; \"what, you MUST be a tell-tale!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I never told any tales of anybody, and I should be very sorry to get\\r\\nanyone into a scrape; but for all that I shall not tell a lie, either for\\r\\nmyself or anybody else, let you call me what names you will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if I were to give you something that you would like,\" said\\r\\nCorkscrew--\"something that I know you would like!\" repeated Felix.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing you can give me will do,\" answered Franklin, steadily, \"so it is\\r\\nuseless to say any more about it--I hope I shall not be questioned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this hope he was mistaken; for the first thing Mrs. Pomfret did in the\\r\\nmorning was to come into the room to examine and deplore the burnt\\r\\ncurtains, whilst Corkscrew stood by, endeavouring to exculpate himself by\\r\\nall the excuses he could invent.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Pomfret, however, though sometimes blinded by her prejudices, was no\\r\\nfool; and it was absolutely impossible to make her believe that a candle,\\r\\nwhich had been left on the hearth, where Corkscrew protested he had left\\r\\nit, could have set curtains on fire which were at least six feet distant.\\r\\nTurning short round to Franklin, she desired that he would show her where\\r\\nhe found the candle when he came into the room.  He took up the\\r\\ncandlestick; but the moment the housekeeper cast her eye upon it, she\\r\\nsnatched it from his hands; \"How did this candlestick come here?  This\\r\\nwas not the candlestick you found here last night,\" cried she.  \"Yes,\\r\\nindeed it was,\" answered Franklin.  \"That is impossible,\" retorted she,\\r\\nvehemently, \"for I left this candlestick with my own hands last night, in\\r\\nthe hall, the last thing I did, after you,\" said she, turning to the\\r\\nbutler, \"was gone to bed--I\\'m sure of it--Nay, don\\'t you recollect my\\r\\ntaking this JAPANNED CANDLESTICK out of your hand, and making you to go\\r\\nup to bed with the brass one, and I bolted the door at the stair-head\\r\\nafter you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was all very true; but Corkscrew had afterwards gone down from his\\r\\nroom by a back staircase, unbolted that door, and, upon his return from\\r\\nthe alehouse, had taken the japanned candlestick by mistake upstairs, and\\r\\nhad left the brass one in its stead upon the hall table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, ma\\'am,\" said Felix, \"indeed you forget; for Mr. Corkscrew came into\\r\\nmy room to desire me to call him betimes in the morning, and I happened\\r\\nto take particular notice, and he had the japanned candlestick in his\\r\\nhand, and that was just as I heard you, bolting the door. Indeed, ma\\'am\\r\\nyou forget.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, sir,\" retorted Mrs. Pomfret, rising in anger, \"I do not forget;\\r\\nI\\'m not come to be SUPPERANNUATED yet, I hope.  How do you dare to tell\\r\\nme I forget?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, ma\\'am,\" cried Felix, \"I beg your pardon, I did not--I did not mean\\r\\nto say you forgot, but only I thought, perhaps, you might not\\r\\nparticularly remember; for if you please to recollect--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I won\\'t please to recollect just whatever you please, sir!  Hold your\\r\\ntongue; why should you poke yourself into this scrape; what have you to\\r\\ndo with it, I should be glad to know?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing in the world, oh nothing in the world; I\\'m sure I beg your\\r\\npardon, ma\\'am,\" answered Felix, in a soft tone; and, sneaking off, left\\r\\nhis friend Corkscrew to fight his own battle, secretly resolving to\\r\\ndesert in good time, if he saw any danger of the alehouse transactions\\r\\ncoming to light.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorkscrew could make but very blundering excuses for himself and,\\r\\nconscious of guilt, he turned pale, and appeared so much more terrified\\r\\nthan butlers usually appear when detected in a lie, that Mrs. Pomfret\\r\\nresolved, as she said, to sift the matter to the bottom.  Impatiently did\\r\\nshe wait till the clock struck nine, and her mistress\\' bell rang, the\\r\\nsignal for her attendance at her levee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you find yourself this morning, ma\\'am?\" said she, undrawing the\\r\\ncurtains.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very sleepy, indeed,\" answered her mistress in a drowsy voice; \"I think\\r\\nI must sleep half an hour longer--shut the curtains.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As you please, ma\\'am; but I suppose I had better open a little of the\\r\\nwindow shutter, for it\\'s past nine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But just struck.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh dear, ma\\'am, it struck before I came upstairs, and you know we are\\r\\ntwenty minutes slow--Lord bless us!\" exclaimed Mrs. Pomfret, as she let\\r\\nfall the bar of the window, which roused her mistress.  \"I\\'m sure I beg\\r\\nyour pardon a thousand times--it\\'s only the bar--because I had this great\\r\\nkey in my hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Put down the key, then, or you\\'ll knock something else down; and you may\\r\\nopen the shutters now; for I\\'m quite awake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me! I\\'m so sorry to think of disturbing you,\" cried Mrs. Pomfret,\\r\\nat the same time throwing the shutters wide open; \"but, to be sure,\\r\\nma\\'am, I have something to tell you, which won\\'t let you sleep again in a\\r\\nhurry.  I brought up this here key of the house door for reasons of my\\r\\nown, which I\\'m sure you\\'ll approve of; but I\\'m not come to that part of\\r\\nmy story yet.  I hope you were not disturbed by the noise in the house\\r\\nlast night, ma\\'am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I heard no noise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am surprised at that, though,\" continued Mrs. Pomfret, and proceeded\\r\\nto give a most ample account of the fire, of her fears, and her\\r\\nsuspicions.  \"To be sure, ma\\'am, what I say IS, that, without the spirit\\r\\nof prophecy, one can nowadays account for what has passed.  I\\'m quite\\r\\nclear in my own judgment, that Mr. Corkscrew must have been out last\\r\\nnight after I went to bed; for, besides the japanned candlestick, which\\r\\nof itself I\\'m sure is strong enough to hang a man, there\\'s another\\r\\ncircumstance, ma\\'am, that certifies it to me--though I have not mentioned\\r\\nit, ma\\'am, to no one yet,\" lowering her voice--\"Franklin, when I\\r\\nquestioned him, told me, that he left the lantern in the outside porch in\\r\\nthe court last night, and this morning it was on the kitchen table.  Now,\\r\\nma\\'am, that lantern could not come without hands; and I could not forget\\r\\nabout that, you know; for Franklin says, he\\'s sure he left the lantern\\r\\nout.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you believe HIM?\" inquired her mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure, ma\\'am--how can I help believing him?  I never found him out\\r\\nin the least symptom of a lie since ever he came into the house; so one\\r\\ncan\\'t help believing in him, like him or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Without meaning to tell a falsehood, however,\" said the lady, \"he might\\r\\nmake a mistake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am, he never makes mistakes; it is not his way to go gossiping\\r\\nand tattling; he never tells anything till he\\'s asked, and then it\\'s fit\\r\\nhe should.  About the sirloin of beef, and all, he was right in the end,\\r\\nI found, to do him justice; and I\\'m sure he\\'s right now about the\\r\\nlantern--he\\'s ALWAY\\'S RIGHT\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Churchill could not help smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you had seen him, ma\\'am, last night in the midst of the fire--I\\'m\\r\\nsure we may thank him that we were not burned alive in our beds--and I\\r\\nshall never forget his coming to call me.  Poor fellow! he that I was\\r\\nalways scolding and scolding, enough to make him hate me.  But he\\'s too\\r\\ngood to hate anybody; and I\\'ll be bound I\\'ll make it up to him now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care that you don\\'t go from one extreme into another, Pomfret;\\r\\ndon\\'t spoil the boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am, there\\'s no danger of that; but I\\'m sure if you had seen him\\r\\nlast night yourself, you would think he deserved to be rewarded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so he shall be rewarded,\" said Mrs. Churchill; \"but I will try him\\r\\nmore fully yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s no occasion, I think, for trying him any more, ma\\'am,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nPomfret, who was as violent in her likings as in her dislikes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray desire,\" continued her mistress, \"that he will bring up breakfast\\r\\nthis morning; and leave the key of the house-door, Pomfret, with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Franklin brought the urn into the breakfast-parlour, his mistress\\r\\nwas standing by the fire with the key in her hand.  She spoke to him of\\r\\nhis last night\\'s exertions in terms of much approbation.  \"How long have\\r\\nyou lived with me?\" said she, pausing; \"three weeks, I think?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Three weeks and four days, madam.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is but a short time; yet you have conducted yourself so as to make\\r\\nme think I may depend upon you.  You know this key?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe, madam, it is the key of the house-door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is; I shall trust it in your care.  It is a great trust for so young\\r\\na person as you are.\"  Franklin stood silent, with a firm but modest\\r\\nlook.  \"If you take the charge of this key,\" continued his mistress,\\r\\n\"remember it is upon condition that you never give it out of your own\\r\\nhands.  In the daytime it must not be left in the door.  You must not\\r\\ntell anybody where you keep it at night; and the house-door must not be\\r\\nunlocked after eleven o\\'clock at night, unless by my orders.  Will you\\r\\ntake charge of the key upon these conditions?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will, madam, do anything you order me,\" said Franklin, and received\\r\\nthe key from her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mrs. Churchill\\'s orders were made known, they caused many secret\\r\\nmarvellings and murmurings.  Corkscrew and Felix were disconcerted, and\\r\\ndared not openly avow their discontent; and they treated Franklin with\\r\\nthe greatest seeming kindness and cordiality.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything went on smoothly for three days.  The butler never attempted\\r\\nhis usual midnight visits to the alehouse, but went to bed in proper\\r\\ntime, and paid particular court to Mrs Pomfret, in order to dispel her\\r\\nsuspicions.  She had never had any idea of the real fact, that he and\\r\\nFelix were joined in a plot with house-breakers to rob the house, but\\r\\nthought he only went out at irregular hours to indulge himself in his\\r\\npassion for drinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus stood affairs the night before Mrs. Churchill\\'s birthday.\\r\\nCorkscrew, by the housekeeper\\'s means, ventured to present a petition\\r\\nthat he might go to the play the next day, and his request was granted.\\r\\nFranklin came into the kitchen just when all the servants had gathered\\r\\nround the butler, who, with great importance, was reading aloud the play-\\r\\nbill.  Everybody present soon began to speak at once, and with great\\r\\nenthusiasm talked of the playhouse, the actors, and actresses; and then\\r\\nFelix, in the first pause, turned to Franklin, and said, \"Lord, you know\\r\\nnothing of all this! YOU never went to a play, did you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never,\" said Franklin, and felt, he did not know why, a little ashamed;\\r\\nand he longed extremely to go to one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How should you like to go to the play with me to-morrow?\" said\\r\\nCorkscrew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" exclaimed Franklin, \"I should like it exceedingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you think mistress would let you if I asked?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think maybe she would, if Mrs. Pomfret asked her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But then you have no money, have you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Franklin, sighing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But stay,\" said Corkscrew, \"what I am thinking of is, that if mistress\\r\\nwill let you go, I\\'ll treat you myself, rather than that you should he\\r\\ndisappointed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDelight, surprise and gratitude appeared in Franklin\\'s face at these\\r\\nwords.  Corkscrew rejoiced to see that now, at least, he had found a most\\r\\npowerful temptation.  \"Well then, I\\'ll go just now and ask her.  In the\\r\\nmeantime, lend me the key of the house door for a minute or two.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The key!\" answered Franklin, starting; \"I\\'m sorry, but I can\\'t do that,\\r\\nfor I\\'ve promised my mistress never to let it out of my own hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how will she know anything of the matter?  Run, run, and get it for\\r\\nus.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I CANNOT,\" replied Franklin, resisting the push which the butler\\r\\ngave his shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can\\'t?\" cried Corkscrew, changing his tone; \"then, sir, I can\\'t take\\r\\nyou to the play.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Franklin, sorrowfully, but with steadiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Felix, mimicking him, \"you need not look so\\r\\nimportant, nor fancy yourself such a great man, because you\\'re master of\\r\\na key.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Say no more to him,\" interrupted Corkscrew:  \"let him alone to take his\\r\\nown way.  Felix, you would have no objection, I suppose, to going to the\\r\\nplay with me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I should like it of all things, if I did not come between anybody\\r\\nelse.  But come, come!\" added the hypocrite, assuming a tone of friendly\\r\\npersuasion, \"you won\\'t be such a blockhead, Franklin, as to lose going to\\r\\nthe play for nothing; it\\'s only just obstinacy.  What harm can it do, to\\r\\nlend Mr. Corkscrew the key for five minutes? he\\'ll give it to you back\\r\\nagain safe and sound.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t doubt THAT,\" answered Franklin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then it must be all because you don\\'t wish to oblige Mr. Corkscrew.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, but I can\\'t oblige him in this; for, as I told you before, my\\r\\nmistress trusted me.  I promised never to let the key out of my own\\r\\nhands, and you would not have me break my trust.  Mr. Spencer told me\\r\\nthat was worse than ROBBING.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the word ROBBING both Corkscrew and Felix involuntarily cast down\\r\\ntheir eyes, and turned the conversation immediately, saying, that he did\\r\\nvery right; that they did not really want the key, and had only asked for\\r\\nit just to try if he would keep his word.  \"Shake hands,\" said Corkscrew,\\r\\n\"I am glad to find you out to be an honest fellow!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry you did not think me an honest fellow before, Mr. Corkscrew,\"\\r\\nsaid Franklin, giving his hand rather proudly, and he walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall make no hand of this prig,\" said Corkscrew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But we\\'ll have the key from him in spite of all his obstinacy,\" said\\r\\nFelix; \"and let him make his story good as he can afterwards.  He shall\\r\\nrepent of these airs.  To-night I\\'ll watch him, and find out where he\\r\\nhides the key; and when he\\'s asleep we\\'ll get it without thanking him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis plan Felix put into execution.  They discovered the place where\\r\\nFranklin kept the key at night, stole it whilst he slept, took off the\\r\\nimpression in wax, and carefully replaced it in Franklin\\'s trunk, exactly\\r\\nwhere they found it.\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably our young readers cannot guess what use they could mean to make\\r\\nof this impression of the key in wax.  Knowing how to do mischief is very\\r\\ndifferent from wishing to do it:  and the most innocent persons are\\r\\ngenerally the least ignorant.  By means of the impression, which they had\\r\\nthus obtained, Corkscrew and Felix proposed to get a false key made by\\r\\nPicklock, a smith who belonged to their gang of house-breakers; and with\\r\\nthis false key knew they could open the door whenever they pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle suspecting what had happened, Franklin, the next morning went to\\r\\nunlock the house door, as usual; but finding the key entangled in the\\r\\nlock, he took it out to examine it, and perceived a lump of wax sticking\\r\\nin one of the wards.  Struck with this circumstance, it brought to his\\r\\nmind all that had passed the preceding evening, and being sure that he\\r\\nhad no wax near the key, he began to suspect what had happened; and he\\r\\ncould not help recollecting what he had once heard Felix say, that \"give\\r\\nhim but a halfpenny worth of wax, and he could open the strongest lock\\r\\nthat ever was made by hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these things considered, Franklin resolved to take the key just as it\\r\\nwas, with the wax sticking to it, to his mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was not mistaken when I thought I might trust YOU with this key,\" said\\r\\nMrs. Churchill, after she had heard his story.  \"My brother will be here\\r\\nto-day, and I shall consult him.  In the meantime, say nothing of what\\r\\nhas passed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEvening came, and after tea Mr. Spencer sent for Franklin upstairs.  \"So,\\r\\nMr. Franklin,\" said he, \"I\\'m glad to find you are in such high TRUST in\\r\\nthis family.\"  Franklin bowed.  \"But you have lost, I understand, the\\r\\npleasure of going to the play to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think anything--much, I mean, of that, sir,\" answered Franklin,\\r\\nsmiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are Corkscrew and Felix GONE to the play?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; half an hour ago, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I shall look into his room, and examine the pantry and the plate\\r\\nthat is under his care.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Spencer came to examine the pantry, he found the large salvers\\r\\nand cups in a basket behind the door, and the other things placed so as\\r\\nto be easily carried off.  Nothing at first appeared in Corkscrew\\'s\\r\\nbedchamber, to strengthen their suspicions, till, just as they were going\\r\\nto leave the room, Mrs. Pomfret exclaimed, \"Why, if there is not Mr.\\r\\nCorkscrew\\'s dress coat hanging up there! and if here isn\\'t Felix\\'s fine\\r\\ncravat that he wanted in such a hurry to go to the play!  Why, sir, they\\r\\ncan\\'t be gone to the play.  Look at the cravat.  Ah! upon my word I am\\r\\nafraid they are not at the play.  No, sir, you may be sure that they are\\r\\nplotting with their barbarous gang at the alehouse; and they\\'ll certainly\\r\\nbreak into the house to-night.  We shall all be murdered in our beds, as\\r\\nsure as I\\'m a living woman, sir; but if you\\'ll only take my advice--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, good Mrs. Pomfret,\" Mr. Spencer observed, \"don\\'t be alarmed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, sir, but I won\\'t pretend to sleep in the house, if Franklin isn\\'t\\r\\nto have a blunderbuss, and I a BAGGONET.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall have both, indeed, Mrs. Pomfret; but don\\'t make such a noise,\\r\\nfor everybody will hear you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe love of mystery was the only thing which could have conquered Mrs.\\r\\nPomfret\\'s love of talking.  She was silent, and contented herself the\\r\\nrest of the evening with making signs, looking ominous, and stalking\\r\\nabout the house like one possessed with a secret.\\r\\n\\r\\nEscaped from Mrs. Pomfret\\'s fears and advice, Mr. Spencer went to a shop\\r\\nwithin a few doors of the alehouse, which he heard Corkscrew frequented,\\r\\nand sent to beg to speak to the landlord.  He came; and, when Mr. Spencer\\r\\nquestioned him, confessed that Corkscrew and Felix were actually drinking\\r\\nin his house with two men of suspicious appearance; that, as he passed\\r\\nthrough the passage, he heard them disputing about a key; and that one of\\r\\nthem said, \"Since we\\'ve got the key, we\\'ll go about it to-night.\"  This\\r\\nwas sufficient information.  Mr. Spencer, lest the landlord should give\\r\\nthem information of what was going forwards, took him along with him to\\r\\nBow Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nA constable and proper assistance was sent to Mrs. Churchill\\'s.  They\\r\\nstationed themselves in a back parlour which opened on a passage leading\\r\\nto the butler\\'s pantry, where the plate was kept.  A little after\\r\\nmidnight they heard the hall door open.  Corkscrew and his accomplices\\r\\nwent directly to the pantry; and there Mr. Spencer and the constable\\r\\nimmediately secured them, as they were carrying off their booty.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Churchill and Pomfret had spent the night at the house of an\\r\\nacquaintance in the same street.  \"Well, ma\\'am,\" said Mrs. Pomfret, who\\r\\nhad heard all the news in the morning, \"the villains are all safe, thank\\r\\nGod.  I was afraid to go to the window this morning; but it was my luck\\r\\nto see them all go by to gaol.  They looked so shocking!  I am sure I\\r\\nnever shall forget Felix\\'s look to my dying day!  But poor Franklin!\\r\\nma\\'am; that boy has the best heart in the world.  I could not get him to\\r\\ngive a second look at them as they passed.  Poor fellow! I thought he\\r\\nwould have dropped; and he was so modest, ma\\'am, when Mr. Spencer spoke\\r\\nto him, and told him he had done his duty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And did my brother tell him what reward I intend for him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am, and I\\'m sure Franklin thinks no more of REWARD than I do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I intend,\" continued Mrs. Churchill, \"to sell some of my old useless\\r\\nplate, and to lay it out in an annuity for Franklin\\'s life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La, ma\\'am!\" exclaimed Mrs. Pomfret, with unfeigned joy, \"I\\'m sure you\\r\\nare very good; and I\\'m very glad of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And,\" continued Mrs. Churchill, \"here are some tickets for the play,\\r\\nwhich I shall beg you, Pomfret, to give him, and to take him with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very much obliged to you, indeed, ma\\'am; and I\\'ll go with him with\\r\\nall my heart, and choose such plays as won\\'t do no prejudice to his\\r\\nmorality.  And, ma\\'am,\" continued Mrs. Pomfret, \"the night after the fire\\r\\nI left him my great Bible and my watch, in my will; for I never was more\\r\\nmistaken at the first in any boy in my born days; but he has won me by\\r\\nhis own DESERTS, and I shall from this time forth love all the\\r\\nVILLAINTROPIC folks for his sake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSIMPLE SUSAN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Waked as her custom was, before the day,\\r\\n     To do the observance due to sprightly May.\\r\\n                                          Dryden.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a retired hamlet on the borders of Wales, between Oswestry and\\r\\nShrewsbury, it is still the custom to celebrate the 1st of May.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children of the village, who look forward to this rural festival with\\r\\njoyful eagerness, usually meet on the last day of April to make up their\\r\\nnosegays for the morning and to choose their queen.  Their customary\\r\\nplace of meeting is at a hawthorn, which stands in a little green nook,\\r\\nopen on one side to a shady lane, and separated on the other side by a\\r\\nthick sweet-brier and hawthorn hedge from the garden of an attorney.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis attorney began the world with nothing, but he contrived to scrape\\r\\ntogether a good deal of money, everybody knew how.  He built a new house\\r\\nat the entrance of the village, and had a large, well fenced garden, yet,\\r\\nnotwithstanding his fences, he never felt himself secure.  Such were his\\r\\nlitigious habits, and his suspicious temper, that he was constantly at\\r\\nvariance with his simple and peaceable neighbours.  Some pig, or dog, or\\r\\ngoat, or goose was for ever trespassing.  His complaints and his\\r\\nextortions wearied and alarmed the whole hamlet.  The paths in his fields\\r\\nwere at length unfrequented, his stiles were blocked up with stones or\\r\\nstuffed with brambles and briers, so that not a gosling could creep\\r\\nunder, or a giant get over them.  Indeed, so careful were even the\\r\\nvillage children of giving offence to this irritable man of the law, that\\r\\nthey would not venture to fly a kite near his fields lest it should\\r\\nentangle in his trees, or fall upon his meadow.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Case, for this was the name of our attorney, had a son and a\\r\\ndaughter, to whose education he had not time to attend, as his whole soul\\r\\nwas intent upon accumulating for them a fortune.  For several years he\\r\\nsuffered his children to run wild in the village; but suddenly, on his\\r\\nbeing appointed to a considerable agency, he began to think of making his\\r\\nchildren a little genteel.  He sent his son to learn Latin; he hired a\\r\\nmaid to wait upon his daughter Barbara; and he strictly forbade her\\r\\nthenceforward to keep company with any of the poor children, who had\\r\\nhitherto been her playfellows.  They were not sorry for this prohibition,\\r\\nbecause she had been their tyrant rather than their companion.  She was\\r\\nvexed to observe that her absence was not regretted, and she was\\r\\nmortified to perceive that she could not humble them by any display of\\r\\nairs and finery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was one poor girl, amongst her former associates, to whom she had a\\r\\npeculiar dislike,--Susan Price, a sweet tempered, modest, sprightly,\\r\\nindustrious lass, who was the pride and delight of the village.  Her\\r\\nfather rented a small farm, and, unfortunately for him, he lived near\\r\\nAttorney Case.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara used often to sit at her window, watching Susan at work.\\r\\nSometimes she saw her in the neat garden raking the beds, or weeding the\\r\\nborders; sometimes she was kneeling at her beehive with fresh flowers for\\r\\nher bees; sometimes she was in the poultry yard, scattering corn from her\\r\\nsieve amongst the eager chickens; and in the evening she was often seated\\r\\nin a little honeysuckle arbour, with a clean, light, three-legged deal\\r\\ntable before her, upon which she put her plain work.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan had been taught to work neatly by her good mother, who was very\\r\\nfond of her, and to whom she was most gratefully attached.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Price was an intelligent, active, domestic woman; but her health was\\r\\nnot robust.  She earned money, however, by taking in plain work; and she\\r\\nwas famous for baking excellent bread and breakfast cakes.  She was\\r\\nrespected in the village, for her conduct as a wife and as a mother, and\\r\\nall were eager to show her attention.  At her door the first branch of\\r\\nhawthorn was always placed on May morning, and her Susan was usually\\r\\nQueen of the May.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now time to choose the Queen.  The setting sun shone full upon the\\r\\npink blossoms of the hawthorn, when the merry group assembled upon their\\r\\nlittle green.  Barbara was now walking in sullen state in her father\\'s\\r\\ngarden.  She heard the busy voices in the lane, and she concealed herself\\r\\nbehind the high hedge, that she might listen to their conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where\\'s Susan?\" were the first unwelcome words which she overheard.\\r\\n\"Ay, where\\'s Susan?\" repeated Philip, stopping short in the middle of a\\r\\nnew tune that he was playing on his pipe.  \"I wish Susan would come!  I\\r\\nwant her to sing me this same tune over again; I have not it yet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I wish Susan would come, I\\'m sure,\" cried a little girl, whose lap\\r\\nwas full of primroses.  \"Susan will give me some thread to tie up my\\r\\nnosegays, and she\\'ll show me where the fresh violets grow; and she has\\r\\npromised to give me a great bunch of her double cowslips to wear to-\\r\\nmorrow.  I wish she would come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing can be done without Susan!  She always shows us where the nicest\\r\\nflowers are to be found in the lanes and meadows,\" said they.  \"She must\\r\\nmake up the garlands; and she shall be Queen of the May!\" exclaimed a\\r\\nmultitude of little voices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But she does not come!\" said Philip.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose, who was her particular friend, now came forward to assure the\\r\\nimpatient assembly, \"that she would answer for it Susan would come as\\r\\nsoon as she possibly could, and that she probably was detained by\\r\\nbusiness at home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little electors thought that all business should give way to theirs,\\r\\nand Rose was dispatched to summon her friend immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell her to make haste,\" cried Philip.  \"Attorney Case dined at the\\r\\nAbbey to-day--luckily for us.  If he comes home and finds us here, maybe\\r\\nhe\\'ll drive us away; for he says this bit of ground belongs to his\\r\\ngarden:  though that is not true, I\\'m sure; for Farmer Price knows, and\\r\\nsays, it was always open to the road.  The Attorney wants to get our\\r\\nplayground, so he does.  I wish he and his daughter Bab, or Miss Barbara,\\r\\nas she must now be called, were a hundred miles off, out of our way, I\\r\\nknow.  No later than yesterday she threw down my nine-pins in one of her\\r\\nill-humours, as she was walking by with her gown all trailing in the\\r\\ndust.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" cried Mary, the little primrose-girl, \"her gown is always\\r\\ntrailing.  She does not hold it up nicely, like Susan; and with all her\\r\\nfine clothes she never looks half so neat.  Mamma says she wishes I may\\r\\nbe like Susan, when I grow up to be a great girl, and so do I.  I should\\r\\nnot like to look conceited as Barbara does, if I was ever so rich.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rich or poor,\" said Philip, \"it does not become a girl to look\\r\\nconceited, much less BOLD, as Barbara did the other day, when she was at\\r\\nher father\\'s door without a hat upon her head, staring at the strange\\r\\ngentleman who stopped hereabout to let his horse drink.  I know what he\\r\\nthought of Bab by his looks, and of Susan, too; for Susan was in her\\r\\ngarden, bending down a branch of the laburnum-tree, looking at its yellow\\r\\nflowers, which were just come out; and when the gentleman asked her how\\r\\nmany miles it was from Shrewsbury, she answered him so modest!--not\\r\\nbashful, like as if she had never seen nobody before--but just right; and\\r\\nthen she pulled on her straw hat, which was fallen back with her looking\\r\\nup at the laburnum, and she went her ways home; and the gentleman says to\\r\\nme, after she was gone, \\'Pray, who is that neat, modest girl--?\\'  But I\\r\\nwish Susan would come,\" cried Philip, interrupting himself,\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was all this time, as her friend Rose rightly guessed, busy at\\r\\nhome.  She was detained by her father\\'s returning later than usual.  His\\r\\nsupper was ready for him nearly an hour before he came home; and Susan\\r\\nswept up the ashes twice, and twice put on wood to make a cheerful blaze\\r\\nfor him; but at last, when he did come in, he took no notice of the blaze\\r\\nor of Susan; and when his wife asked him how he did, he made no answer,\\r\\nbut stood with his back to the fire, looking very gloomy.  Susan put his\\r\\nsupper upon the table, and set his own chair for him; but he pushed away\\r\\nthe chair and turned from the table, saying--\"I shall eat nothing, child!\\r\\nWhy have you such a fire to roast me at this time of the year?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You said yesterday, father, I thought, that you liked a little cheerful\\r\\nwood fire in the evening; and there was a great shower of hail; your coat\\r\\nis quite wet, we must dry it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take it, then, child,\" said he, pulling it off--\"I shall soon have no\\r\\ncoat to dry--and take my hat, too,\" said he, throwing it upon the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan hung up his hat, put his coat over the back of a chair to dry, and\\r\\nthen stood anxiously looking at her mother, who was not well; she had\\r\\nthis day fatigued herself with baking; and now, alarmed by her husband\\'s\\r\\nmoody behaviour, she sat down pale and trembling.  He threw himself into\\r\\na chair, folded his arms, and fixed his eyes upon the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was the first who ventured to break silence.  Happy the father who\\r\\nhas such a daughter as Susan!--her unaltered sweetness of temper, and her\\r\\nplayful, affectionate caresses, at last somewhat dissipated her father\\'s\\r\\nmelancholy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could not be prevailed upon to eat any of the supper which had been\\r\\nprepared for him; however, with a faint smile, he told Susan that he\\r\\nthought he could eat one of her guinea-hen\\'s eggs.  She thanked him, and\\r\\nwith that nimble alacrity which marks the desire to please, she ran to\\r\\nher neat chicken-yard; but, alas!, her guinea-hen was not there--it had\\r\\nstrayed into the attorney\\'s garden.  She saw it through the paling, and\\r\\ntimidly opening the little gate, she asked Miss Barbara, who was walking\\r\\nslowly by, to let her come in and take her guinea-hen.  Barbara, who was\\r\\nat this instant reflecting, with no agreeable feelings, upon the\\r\\nconversation of the village children, to which she had recently listened,\\r\\nstarted when she heard Susan\\'s voice, and with a proud, ill-humoured look\\r\\nand voice, refused her request.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shut the gate,\" said Barbara, \"you have no business in our garden; and\\r\\nas for your hen, I shall keep it; it is always flying in here, and\\r\\nplaguing us, and my father says it is a trespasser; and he told me I\\r\\nmight catch it and keep it the next time it got in, and it is in now.\"\\r\\nThen Barbara called to her maid, Betty, and bid her catch the mischievous\\r\\nhen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my guinea-hen! my pretty guinea-hen!\" cried Susan, as they hunted\\r\\nthe frightened, screaming creature from corner to corner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here we have got it!\" said Betty, holding it fast by the legs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now pay damages, Queen Susan, or good-bye to your pretty guinea-hen,\"\\r\\nsaid Barbara, in an insulting tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Damages! what damages?\" said Susan; \"tell me what I must pay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A shilling,\" said Barbara.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, if sixpence would do!\" said Susan; \"I have but sixpence of my own in\\r\\nthe world, and here it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It won\\'t do,\" said Barbara, turning her back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, but hear me,\" cried Susan; \"let me at least come in to look for its\\r\\neggs.  I only want ONE for my father\\'s supper; you shall have all the\\r\\nrest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s your father, or his supper to us? is he so nice that he can eat\\r\\nnone but guinea-hen\\'s eggs?\" said Barbara.  \"If you want your hen and\\r\\nyour eggs, pay for them, and you\\'ll have them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have but sixpence, and you say that won\\'t do,\" said Susan with a sigh,\\r\\nas she looked at her favourite, which was in the maid\\'s grasping hands,\\r\\nstruggling and screaming in vain.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan retired disconsolate.  At the door of her father\\'s cottage she saw\\r\\nher friend Rose, who was just come to summon her to the hawthorn bush.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are all at the hawthorn, and I am come for you.  We can do nothing\\r\\nwithout YOU, dear Susan,\" cried Rose, running to meet her, at the moment\\r\\nshe saw her.  \"You are chosen Queen of the May--come, make haste.  But\\r\\nwhat is the matter? why do you look so sad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said Susan, \"don\\'t wait for me; I can\\'t come to you, but,\" added\\r\\nshe, pointing to the tuft of double cowslips in the garden, \"gather those\\r\\nfor poor little Mary; I promised them to her, and tell her the violets\\r\\nare under a hedge just opposite the turnstile, on the right as we go to\\r\\nchurch.  Good-bye! never mind me; I can\\'t come--I can\\'t stay, for my\\r\\nfather wants me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But don\\'t turn away your face; I won\\'t keep you a moment; only tell me\\r\\nwhat\\'s the matter,\" said her friend, following her into the cottage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, nothing, not much,\" said Susan; \"only that I wanted the egg in a\\r\\ngreat hurry for father, it would not have vexed me--to be sure I should\\r\\nhave clipped my guinea-hen\\'s wings, and then she could not have flown\\r\\nover the hedge; but let us think no more about it, now,\" added she,\\r\\ntwinkling away a tear.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Rose, however, learnt that her friend\\'s guinea-hen was detained\\r\\nprisoner by the attorney\\'s daughter, she exclaimed, with all the honest\\r\\nwarmth of indignation, and instantly ran back to tell the story to her\\r\\ncompanions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Barbara! ay; like father, like daughter,\" cried Farmer Price, starting\\r\\nfrom the thoughtful attitude in which he had been fixed, and drawing his\\r\\nchair closer to his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see something is amiss with me, wife--I\\'ll tell you what it is.\"  As\\r\\nhe lowered his voice, Susan, who was not sure that he wished she should\\r\\nhear what he was going to say, retired from behind his chair.  \"Susan,\\r\\ndon\\'t go; sit you down here, my sweet Susan,\" said he, making room for\\r\\nher upon his chair; \"I believe I was a little cross when I came in first\\r\\ntonight; but I had something to vex me, as you shall hear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About a fortnight ago, you know, wife,\" continued he, \"there was a\\r\\nballoting in our town for the militia; now at that time I wanted but ten\\r\\ndays of forty years of age; and the attorney told me I was a fool for not\\r\\ncalling myself plump forty.  But the truth is the truth, and it is what I\\r\\nthink fittest to be spoken at all times come what will of it.  So I was\\r\\ndrawn for a militiaman; but when I thought how loth you and I would be to\\r\\npart, I was main glad to hear that I could get off by paying eight or\\r\\nnine guineas for a substitute--only I had not the nine guineas--for, you\\r\\nknow, we had bad luck with our sheep this year, and they died away one\\r\\nafter another--but that was no excuse, so I went to Attorney Case, and,\\r\\nwith a power of difficulty, I got him to lend me the money; for which, to\\r\\nbe sure, I gave him something, and left my lease of our farm with him, as\\r\\nhe insisted upon it, by way of security for the loan.  Attorney Case is\\r\\ntoo many for me.  He has found what he calls a flaw in my lease; and the\\r\\nlease, he tells me, is not worth a farthing, and that he can turn us all\\r\\nout of our farm to-morrow if he pleases; and sure enough he will please,\\r\\nfor I have thwarted him this day, and he swears he\\'ll be revenged of me.\\r\\nIndeed, he has begun with me badly enough already.  I\\'m not come to the\\r\\nworst part of my story yet--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Farmer Price made a dead stop; and his wife and Susan looked up in\\r\\nhis face, breathless with anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must come out,\" said he, with a short sigh; \"I must leave you in\\r\\nthree days, wife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Must you?\" said his wife, in a faint, resigned voice.  \"Susan, love,\\r\\nopen the window.\"  Susan ran to open the window, and then returned to\\r\\nsupport her mother\\'s head.  When she came a little to herself she sat up,\\r\\nbegged that her husband would go on, and that nothing might be concealed\\r\\nfrom her.  Her husband had no wish indeed to conceal anything from a wife\\r\\nhe loved so well; but, firm as he was, and steady to his maxim, that the\\r\\ntruth was the thing the fittest to be spoken at all times, his voice\\r\\nfaltered, and it was with great difficulty that he brought himself to\\r\\nspeak the whole truth at this moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact was this.  Case met Farmer Price as he was coming home,\\r\\nwhistling, from a new ploughed field.  The attorney had just dined at The\\r\\nAbbey.  The Abbey was the family seat of an opulent baronet in the\\r\\nneighbourhood, to whom Mr. Case had been agent.  The baronet died\\r\\nsuddenly, and his estate and title devolved to a younger brother, who was\\r\\nnow just arrived in the country, and to whom Mr. Case was eager to pay\\r\\nhis court, in hopes of obtaining his favour.  Of the agency he flattered\\r\\nhimself that he was pretty secure; and he thought that he might assume\\r\\nthe tone of command towards the tenants, especially towards one who was\\r\\nsome guineas in debt, and in whose lease there was a flaw.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccosting the farmer in a haughty manner, the attorney began with, \"So,\\r\\nFarmer Price, a word with you, if you please.  Walk on here, man, beside\\r\\nmy horse, and you\\'ll hear me.  You have changed your opinion, I hope,\\r\\nabout that bit of land--that corner at the end of my garden?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As how, Mr. Case?\" said the farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As how, man!  Why, you said something about its not belonging to me,\\r\\nwhen you heard me talk of inclosing it the other day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I did,\" said Price, \"and so I do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nProvoked and astonished at the firm tone in which these words were\\r\\npronounced, the attorney was upon the point of swearing that he would\\r\\nhave his revenge; but, as his passions were habitually attentive to the\\r\\nLETTER of the law, he refrained from any hasty expression, which might,\\r\\nhe was aware, in a court of justice, be hereafter brought against him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My good friend, Mr. Price,\" said he, in a soft voice, and pale with\\r\\nsuppressed rage.  He forced a smile.  \"I\\'m under the necessity of calling\\r\\nin the money I lent you some time ago, and you will please to take\\r\\nnotice, that it must be paid to-morrow morning.  I wish you a good\\r\\nevening.  You have the money ready for me, I daresay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said the farmer, \"not a guinea of it; but John Simpson, who was my\\r\\nsubstitute, has not left our village yet.  I\\'ll get the money back from\\r\\nhim, and go myself, if so be it must be so, into the militia--so I will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney did not expect such a determination, and he represented, in\\r\\na friendly, hypocritical tone to Price, that he had no wish to drive him\\r\\nto such an extremity; that it would be the height of folly in him TO RUN\\r\\nHIS HEAD AGAINST A WALL FOR NO PURPOSE.  \"You don\\'t mean to take the\\r\\ncorner into your own garden, do you, Price?\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I?\" said the farmer, \"God forbid! it\\'s none of mine, I never take what\\r\\ndoes not belong to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True, right, very proper, of course,\" said Mr. Case; \"but then you have\\r\\nno interest in life in the land in question?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then why so stiff about it, Price?  All I want of you to say--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To say that black is white, which I won\\'t do, Mr. Case.  The ground is a\\r\\nthing not worth talking of; but it\\'s neither yours nor mine.  In my\\r\\nmemory, since the NEW lane was made, it has always been open to the\\r\\nparish; and no man shall inclose it with my good-will.  Truth is truth,\\r\\nand must be spoken; justice is justice, and should be done, Mr.\\r\\nAttorney.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And law is law, Mr. Farmer, and shall have its course, to your cost,\"\\r\\ncried the attorney, exasperated by the dauntless spirit of this village\\r\\nHampden.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere they parted.  The glow of enthusiasm, the pride of virtue, which\\r\\nmade our hero brave, could not render him insensible.  As he drew nearer\\r\\nhome, many melancholy thoughts pressed upon his heart.  He passed the\\r\\ndoor of his own cottage with resolute steps, however, and went through\\r\\nthe village in search of the man who had engaged to be his substitute.\\r\\nHe found him, told him how the matter stood; and luckily the man, who had\\r\\nnot yet spent the money, was willing to return it; as there were many\\r\\nothers drawn for the militia, who, he observed, would be glad to give him\\r\\nthe same price, or more, for his services.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moment Price got the money, he hastened to Mr. Case\\'s house, walked\\r\\nstraight forward into his room, and laying the money down upon his desk,\\r\\n\"There, Mr. Attorney, are your nine guineas; count them; now I have done\\r\\nwith you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not yet,\" said the attorney, jingling the money triumphantly in his\\r\\nhand.  \"We\\'ll give you a taste of the law, my good sir, or I\\'m mistaken.\\r\\nYou forgot the flaw in your lease, which I have safe in this desk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, my lease,\" said the farmer, who had almost forgot to ask for it till\\r\\nhe was thus put in mind of it by the attorney\\'s imprudent threat.  \"Give\\r\\nme my lease, Mr. Case.  I\\'ve paid my money; you have no right to keep the\\r\\nlease any longer, whether it is a bad one or a good one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pardon me,\" said the attorney, locking his desk, and putting the key\\r\\ninto his pocket, \"possession, my honest friend,\" cried he, striking his\\r\\nhand upon the desk, \"is nine points of the law.  Good night to you.  I\\r\\ncannot in conscience return a lease to a tenant in which I know there is\\r\\na capital flaw.  It is my duty to show it to my employer; or, in other\\r\\nwords, to your new landlord, whose agent I have good reasons to expect I\\r\\nshall be; you will live to repent your obstinacy, Mr. Price.  Your\\r\\nservant, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPrice retired with melancholy feelings, but not intimidated.  Many a man\\r\\nreturns home with a gloomy countenance, who has not quite so much cause\\r\\nfor vexation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Susan heard her father\\'s story, she quite forgot her guinea-hen, and\\r\\nher whole soul was intent upon her poor mother, who, notwithstanding her\\r\\nutmost exertion, could not support herself under this sudden stroke of\\r\\nmisfortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the night Susan was called up; her mother\\'s fever ran\\r\\nhigh for some hours; but towards morning it abated, and she fell into a\\r\\nsoft sleep with Susan\\'s hand locked fast in hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan sat motionless, and breathed softly, lest she should disturb her.\\r\\nThe rushlight, which stood beside the bed, was now burnt low; the long\\r\\nshadow of the tall wicker chair flitted, faded, appeared, and vanished,\\r\\nas the flame rose and sunk in the socket.  Susan was afraid that the\\r\\ndisagreeable smell might waken her mother; and, gently disengaging her\\r\\nhand, she went on tiptoe to extinguish the candle.  All was silent:  the\\r\\ngrey light of the morning was now spreading over every object; the sun\\r\\nrose slowly, and Susan stood at the lattice window, looking through the\\r\\nsmall leaded, cross-barred panes at the splendid spectacle.  A few birds\\r\\nbegan to chirp; but, as Susan was listening to them, her mother started\\r\\nin her sleep, and spoke unintelligibly.  Susan hung up a white apron\\r\\nbefore the window to keep out the light, and just then she heard the\\r\\nsound of music at a distance in the village.  As it approached nearer,\\r\\nshe knew that it was Philip playing upon his pipe and tabor.  She\\r\\ndistinguished the merry voices of her companions \"carolling in honour of\\r\\nthe May,\" and soon she saw them coming towards her father\\'s cottage, with\\r\\nbranches and garlands in their hands.  She opened quick, but gently, the\\r\\nlatch of the door, and ran out to meet them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here she is!--here\\'s Susan!\" they exclaimed, joyfully.  \"Here\\'s the\\r\\nQueen of the May.\"  \"And here\\'s her crown!\" cried Rose, pressing forward;\\r\\nbut Susan put her finger upon her lips, and pointed to her mother\\'s\\r\\nwindow.  Philip\\'s pipe stopped instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" said Susan, \"my mother is ill; I can\\'t leave her, you know.\"\\r\\nThen gently putting aside the crown, her companions bid her say who\\r\\nshould wear it for her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you, dear Rose?\" said she, placing the garland upon her friend\\'s\\r\\nhead.  \"It\\'s a charming May morning,\" added she, with a smile; \"good-bye.\\r\\nWe sha\\'n\\'t hear your voices or the pipe when you have turned the corner\\r\\ninto the village; so you need only stop till then, Philip.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall stop for all day,\" said Philip:  \"I\\'ve no mind to play any\\r\\nmore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-bye, poor Susan.  It is a pity you can\\'t come with us,\" said all\\r\\nthe children; and little Mary ran after Susan to the cottage door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I forgot to thank you,\" said she, \"for the double cowslips; look how\\r\\npretty they are, and smell how sweet the violets are in my bosom, and\\r\\nkiss me quick, for I shall be left behind.\"  Susan kissed the little\\r\\nbreathless girl, and returned softly to the side of her mother\\'s bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How grateful that child is to me, for a cowslip only!  How can I be\\r\\ngrateful enough to such a mother as this?\" said Susan to herself, as she\\r\\nbent over her sleeping mother\\'s pale countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer mother\\'s unfinished knitting lay upon a table near the bed, and Susan\\r\\nsat down in her wicker arm-chair, and went on with the row, in the middle\\r\\nof which her hand stopped the preceding evening.  \"She taught me to knit,\\r\\nshe taught me everything that I know,\" thought Susan, \"and the best of\\r\\nall, she taught me to love her, to wish to be like her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer mother, when she awakened, felt much refreshed by her tranquil sleep,\\r\\nand observing that it was a delightful morning, said, \"that she had been\\r\\ndreaming she heard music; but that the drum frightened her, because she\\r\\nthought it was the signal for her husband to be carried away by a whole\\r\\nregiment of soldiers, who had pointed their bayonets at him.  But that\\r\\nwas but a dream, Susan; I awoke, and knew it was a dream, and I then fell\\r\\nasleep, and have slept soundly ever since.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow painful it is to awake to the remembrance of misfortune.  Gradually\\r\\nas this poor woman collected her scattered thoughts, she recalled the\\r\\ncircumstances of the preceding evening.  She was too certain that she had\\r\\nheard from her husband\\'s own lips the words, \"I MUST LEAVE YOU IN THREE\\r\\nDAYS\"; and she wished that she could sleep again, and think it all a\\r\\ndream.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he\\'ll want, he\\'ll want a hundred things,\" said she, starting up.  \"I\\r\\nmust get his linen ready for him.  I\\'m afraid it\\'s very late.  Susan, why\\r\\ndid you let me lie so long?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Everything shall be ready, dear mother; only don\\'t hurry yourself,\" said\\r\\nSusan.  And indeed her mother was ill able to bear any hurry, or to do\\r\\nany work this day.  Susan\\'s affectionate, dexterous, sensible activity\\r\\nwas never more wanted, or more effectual.  She understood so readily, she\\r\\nobeyed so exactly; and when she was left to her own discretion, judged so\\r\\nprudently, that her mother had little trouble and no anxiety in directing\\r\\nher.  She said that Susan never did too little, or too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was mending her father\\'s linen, when Rose tapped softly at the\\r\\nwindow, and beckoned to her to come out.  She went out.  \"How does your\\r\\nmother do, in the first place?\" said Rose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Better, thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s well, and I have a little bit of good news for you besides--\\r\\nhere,\" said she, pulling out a glove, in which there was money, \"we\\'ll\\r\\nget the guinea-hen back again--we have all agreed about it.  This is the\\r\\nmoney that has been given to us in the village this May morning.  At\\r\\nevery door they gave silver.  See how generous they have been--twelve\\r\\nshillings, I assure you.  Now we are a match for Miss Barbara.  You won\\'t\\r\\nlike to leave home; I\\'ll go to Barbara, and you shall see your guinea-hen\\r\\nin ten minutes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRose hurried away, pleased with her commission, and to accomplish her\\r\\nbusiness.  Miss Barbara\\'s maid Betty was the first person that was\\r\\nvisible at the attorney\\'s house.  Rose insisted upon seeing Miss Barbara\\r\\nherself, and she was shown into a parlour to the young lady, who was\\r\\nreading a dirty novel, which she put under a heap of law papers as they\\r\\nentered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear, how you STARTLED me!  Is it only you?\" said she to her maid; but\\r\\nas soon as she saw Rose behind the maid, she put on a scornful air.\\r\\n\"Could not ye say I was not at home, Betty?  Well, my good girl, what\\r\\nbrings you here?  Something to borrow or beg, I suppose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMay every ambassador--every ambassador in as good a cause--answer with as\\r\\nmuch dignity and moderation as Rose replied to Barbara upon the present\\r\\noccasion.  She assured her, that the person from whom she came did not\\r\\nsend her either to beg or borrow; that she was able to pay the full value\\r\\nof that for which she came to ask; and, producing her well filled purse,\\r\\n\"I believe that this is a very good shilling,\" said she.  \"If you don\\'t\\r\\nlike it, I will change it, and now you will be so good as to give me\\r\\nSusan\\'s guinea-hen.  It is in her name I ask for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No matter in whose name you ask for it,\" replied Barbara, \"you will not\\r\\nhave it.  Take up your shilling, if you please.  I would have taken a\\r\\nshilling yesterday, if it had been paid at the time properly; but I told\\r\\nSusan, that if it was not paid then, I should keep the hen, and so I\\r\\nshall, I promise her.  You may go back, and tell her so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney\\'s daughter had, whilst Rose opened her negotiation, measured\\r\\nthe depth of her purse with a keen eye; and her penetration discovered\\r\\nthat it contained at least ten shillings.  With proper management she had\\r\\nsome hopes that the guinea-hen might be made to bring in at least half\\r\\nthe money.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose, who was of a warm temper, not quite so fit a match as she had\\r\\nthought herself for the wily Barbara, incautiously exclaimed, \"Whatever\\r\\nit costs us, we are determined to have Susan\\'s favourite hen; so, if one\\r\\nshilling won\\'t do, take two; and if two won\\'t do, why, take three.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shillings sounded provoking upon the table, as she threw them down\\r\\none after another, and Barbara coolly replied, \"Three won\\'t do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you no conscience, Miss Barbara?  Then take four.\"  Barbara shook\\r\\nher head.  A fifth shilling was instantly proffered; but Bab, who now saw\\r\\nplainly that she had the game in her own hands, preserved a cold, cruel\\r\\nsilence.  Rose went on rapidly, bidding shilling after shilling, till she\\r\\nhad completely emptied her purse.  The twelve shillings were spread upon\\r\\nthe table.  Barbara\\'s avarice was moved, she consented for this ransom to\\r\\nliberate her prisoner.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose pushed the money towards her; but just then, recollecting that she\\r\\nwas acting for others more than for herself, and doubting whether she had\\r\\nfull powers to conclude such an extravagant bargain, she gathered up the\\r\\npublic treasure, and with newly-recovered prudence observed that she must\\r\\ngo back to consult her friends.  Her generous little friends were amazed\\r\\nat Barbara\\'s meanness, but with one accord declared that they were most\\r\\nwilling, for their parts, to give up every farthing of the money.  They\\r\\nall went to Susan in a body, and told her so.  \"There\\'s our purse,\" said\\r\\nthey;  \"do what you please with it.\"  They would not wait for one word of\\r\\nthanks, but ran away, leaving only Rose with her to settle the treaty for\\r\\nthe guinea-hen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a certain manner of accepting a favour, which shows true\\r\\ngenerosity of mind.  Many know how to give, but few know how to accept a\\r\\ngift properly.  Susan was touched, but not astonished, by the kindness of\\r\\nher young friends, and she received the purse with as much simplicity as\\r\\nshe would have given it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Rose, \"shall I go back for the guinea-hen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The guinea-hen!\" said Susan, starting from a reverie into which she had\\r\\nfallen, as she contemplated the purse.  \"Certainly I DO long to see my\\r\\npretty guinea-hen once more; but I was not thinking of her just then--I\\r\\nwas thinking of my father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Susan had heard her mother often, in the course of this day, wish\\r\\nthat she had but money enough in the world to pay John Simpson for going\\r\\nto serve in the militia instead of her husband.  \"This, to be sure, will\\r\\ngo but a little way,\" thought Susan; \"but still it may be of some use to\\r\\nmy father.\"  She told her mind to Rose, and concluded by saying,\\r\\ndecidedly, that \"if the money was given to her to dispose of as she\\r\\npleased, she would give it to her father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is all yours, my dear, good Susan,\" cried Rose, with a look of warm\\r\\napprobation.  \"This is so like you--but I\\'m sorry that Miss Bab must keep\\r\\nyour guinea-hen.  I would not be her for all the guinea-hens, or guineas\\r\\neither, in the whole world.  Why, I\\'ll answer for it, the guinea-hen\\r\\nwon\\'t make her happy, and you\\'ll be happy EVEN without; because you are\\r\\ngood.  Let me come and help you to-morrow,\" continued she, looking at\\r\\nSusan\\'s work, \"if you have any more mending work to do--I never liked\\r\\nwork till I worked with you.  I won\\'t forget my thimble or my scissors,\"\\r\\nadded she, laughing--\"though I used to forget them when I was a giddy\\r\\ngirl.  I assure you I am a great hand at my needle, now--try me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan assured her friend that she did not doubt the powers of her needle,\\r\\nand that she would most willingly accept of her services, but that\\r\\nUNLUCKILY she had finished all the needle work immediately wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But do you know,\" said she, \"I shall have a great deal of business to-\\r\\nmorrow; but I won\\'t tell you what it is that I have to do, for I am\\r\\nafraid I shall not succeed; but if I do succeed, I\\'ll come and tell you\\r\\ndirectly, because you will be so glad of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan, who had always been attentive to what her mother taught her, and\\r\\nwho had often assisted her when she was baking bread and cakes for the\\r\\nfamily at the Abbey, had now formed the courageous, but not presumptuous\\r\\nidea, that she could herself undertake to bake a batch of bread.  One of\\r\\nthe servants from the Abbey had been sent all round the village in the\\r\\nmorning in search of bread, and had not been able to procure any that was\\r\\ntolerable.  Mrs. Price\\'s last baking failed for want of good barm.  She\\r\\nwas not now strong enough to attempt another herself; and when the\\r\\nbrewer\\'s boy came with eagerness to tell her that he had some fine fresh\\r\\nyeast, she thanked him, but sighed, and said it would be of no use to\\r\\nher.  Accordingly she went to work with much prudent care, and when her\\r\\nbread the next morning came out of the oven, it was excellent; at least\\r\\nher mother said so, and she was a good judge.  It was sent to the Abbey;\\r\\nand as the family there had not tasted any good bread since their arrival\\r\\nin the country, they also were earnest and warm in its praise.  Inquiries\\r\\nwere made from the housekeeper, and they heard, with some surprise, that\\r\\nthis excellent bread was made by a young girl only twelve years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe housekeeper, who had known Susan from a child, was pleased to have an\\r\\nopportunity in speaking in her favour.  \"She is the most industrious\\r\\nlittle creature, ma\\'am, in the world,\" said she to her mistress.  \"Little\\r\\nI can\\'t so well call her now, since she\\'s grown tall and slender to look\\r\\nat; and glad I am she is grown up likely to look at; for handsome is that\\r\\nhandsome does; she thinks no more of her being handsome than I do myself;\\r\\nyet she has as proper a respect for herself, ma\\'am, as you have; and I\\r\\nalways see her neat, and with her mother, ma\\'am, or fit people, as a girl\\r\\nshould be.  As for her mother, she dotes upon her, as well she may; for I\\r\\nshould myself if I had half such a daughter; and then she has two little\\r\\nbrothers; and she\\'s as good to them, and, my boy Philip says, taught \\'em\\r\\nto read more than the school-mistress, all with tenderness and good\\r\\nnature; but, I beg your pardon, ma\\'am, I cannot stop myself when I once\\r\\nbegin to talk of Susan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have really said enough to excite my curiosity,\" said her mistress;\\r\\n\"pray send for her immediately; we can see her before we go out to walk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe benevolent housekeeper despatched her boy Philip for Susan, who never\\r\\nhappened to be in such an UNTIDY state as to be unable to obey a summons\\r\\nwithout a long preparation.  She had, it is true, been very busy; but\\r\\norderly people can be busy and neat at the same time.  She put on her\\r\\nusual straw hat, and accompanied Rose\\'s mother, who was going with a\\r\\nbasket of cleared muslin to the Abbey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modest simplicity of Susan\\'s appearance and the artless propriety of\\r\\nthe answers she gave to all the questions that were asked her, pleased\\r\\nthe ladies at the Abbey, who were good judges of character and manners.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Arthur Somers had two sisters, sensible, benevolent women.  They were\\r\\nnot of that race of fine ladies who are miserable the moment they come to\\r\\nTHE COUNTRY; nor yet were they of that bustling sort, who quack and\\r\\ndirect all their poor neighbours, for the mere love of managing, or the\\r\\nwant of something to do.  They were judiciously generous; and whilst they\\r\\nwished to diffuse happiness, they were not peremptory in requiring that\\r\\npeople should be happy precisely their own way.  With these dispositions,\\r\\nand with a well informed brother, who, though he never wished to direct,\\r\\nwas always willing to assist in their efforts to do good, there were\\r\\nreasonable hopes that these ladies would be a blessing to the poor\\r\\nvillagers amongst whom they were now settled.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Miss Somers had spoken to Susan, she inquired for her brother;\\r\\nbut Sir Arthur was in his study, and a gentleman was with him on\\r\\nbusiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was desirous of returning to her mother, and the ladies therefore\\r\\nwould not detain her.  Miss Somers told her, with a smile, when she took\\r\\nleave, that she would call upon her in the evening at six o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was impossible that such a grand event as Susan\\'s visit to the Abbey\\r\\ncould long remain unknown to Barbara Case and her gossiping maid.  They\\r\\nwatched eagerly for the moment of her return, that they might satisfy\\r\\ntheir curiosity.  \"There she is, I declare, just come into her garden,\"\\r\\ncried Bab; \"I\\'ll run in and get it all out of her in a minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBab could descend, without shame, whenever it suited her purposes, from\\r\\nthe height of insolent pride to the lowest meanness of fawning\\r\\nfamiliarity.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was gathering some marigolds and some parsley for her mother\\'s\\r\\nbroth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, Susan,\" said Bab, who came close up to her before she perceived it,\\r\\n\"how goes the world with you to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother is rather better to-day, she says, ma\\'am--thank you,\" replies\\r\\nSusan, coldly but civilly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MA\\'AM! dear, how polite we are grown of a sudden!\" cried Bab, winking at\\r\\nher maid.  \"One may see you\\'ve been in good company this morning--hey,\\r\\nSusan?  Come, let\\'s hear about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you see the ladies themselves, or was it only the housekeeper sent\\r\\nfor you?\" said the maid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What room did you go into?\" continued Bab.  \"Did you see Miss Somers, or\\r\\nSir Arthur?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Somers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La! she saw Miss Somers!  Betty, I must hear about it.  Can\\'t you stop\\r\\ngathering those things for a minute, and chat a bit with us, Susan?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t stay, indeed, Miss Barbara; for my mother\\'s broth is just\\r\\nwanted, and I\\'m in a hurry.\"  Susan ran home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord, her head is full of broth now,\" said Bab to her maid; \"and she has\\r\\nnot a word for herself, though she has been abroad.  My papa may well\\r\\ncall her Simple Susan; for simple she is, and simple she will be, all the\\r\\nworld over.  For my part, I think she\\'s little better than a downright\\r\\nsimpleton.  But, however, simple or not, I\\'ll get what I want out of her.\\r\\nShe\\'ll be able to speak, maybe, when she has settled the grand matter of\\r\\nthe broth.  I\\'ll step in and ask to see her mother, that will put her in\\r\\na good humour in a trice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara followed Susan into the cottage, and found her occupied with the\\r\\ngrand affair of the broth.  \"Is it ready?\" said Bab, peeping into the pot\\r\\nthat was over the fire.  \"Dear, how savoury it smells!  I\\'ll wait till\\r\\nyou go in with it to your mother; for I must ask her how she does\\r\\nmyself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you please to sit down then, miss,\" said Simple Susan, with a\\r\\nsmile; for at this instant she forgot the guinea-hen; \"I have but just\\r\\nput the parsley into the broth; but it soon will be ready.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this interval Bab employed herself, much to her own satisfaction,\\r\\nin cross-questioning Susan.  She was rather provoked indeed that she\\r\\ncould not learn exactly how each of the ladies was dressed, and what\\r\\nthere was to be for dinner at the Abbey; and she was curious beyond\\r\\nmeasure to find out what Miss Somers meant, by saying that she would call\\r\\nat Mr. Price\\'s cottage at six o\\'clock in the evening.  \"What do you think\\r\\nshe could mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought she meant what she said,\" replied Susan, \"that she would come\\r\\nhere at six o\\'clock.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, that\\'s as plain as a pike-staff,\" said Barbara; \"but what else did\\r\\nshe mean, think you?  People, you know, don\\'t always mean exactly,\\r\\ndownright, neither more nor less than what they say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not always,\" said Susan, with an arch smile, which convinced Barbara\\r\\nthat she was not quite a simpleton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"NOT ALWAYS,\" repeated Barbara colouring,--\"oh, then I suppose you have\\r\\nsome guess at what Miss Somers meant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Susan, \"I was not thinking about Miss Somers, when I said not\\r\\nalways.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How nice that broth does look,\" resumed Barbara, after a pause.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan had now poured the broth into a basin, and as she strewed over it\\r\\nthe bright orange marigolds, it looked very tempting.  She tasted it, and\\r\\nadded now a little salt, and now a little more, till she thought it was\\r\\njust to her mother\\'s taste.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! _I_ must taste it,\" said Bab, taking the basin up greedily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Won\\'t you take a spoon?\" said Susan, trembling at the large mouthfuls\\r\\nwhich Barbara sucked up with a terrible noise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take a spoonful, indeed!\" exclaimed Barbara, setting down the basin in\\r\\nhigh anger.  \"The next time I taste your broth you shall affront me, if\\r\\nyou dare!  The next time I set my foot in this house, you shall be as\\r\\nsaucy to me as you please.\"  And she flounced out of the house, repeating\\r\\n\"TAKE A SPOON, PIG, was what you meant to say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan stood in amazement at the beginning of this speech; but the\\r\\nconcluding words explained to her the mystery.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome years before this time, when Susan was a very little girl, and could\\r\\nscarcely speak plain, as she was eating a basin of bread and milk for her\\r\\nsupper at the cottage door, a great pig came up, and put his nose into\\r\\nthe basin.  Susan was willing that the pig should have some share of the\\r\\nbread and milk; but as she ate with a spoon and he with his large mouth,\\r\\nshe presently discovered that he was likely to have more than his share;\\r\\nand in a simple tone of expostulation she said to him, \"Take a POON,\\r\\npig.\"*  The saying become proverbial in the village.  Susan\\'s little\\r\\ncompanions repeated it, and applied it upon many occasions, whenever\\r\\nanyone claimed more than his share of anything good.  Barbara, who was\\r\\nthen not Miss Barbara, but plain Bab, and who had played with all the\\r\\npoor children in the neighbourhood, was often reproved in her unjust\\r\\nmethods of division by Susan\\'s proverb.  Susan, as she grew up, forgot\\r\\nthe childish saying; but the remembrance of it rankled in Barbara\\'s mind,\\r\\nand it was to this that she suspected Susan had alluded, when she\\r\\nrecommended a spoon to her, whilst she was swallowing the basin of broth.\\r\\n\\r\\n*This is a true anecdote.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La, miss,\" said Barbara\\'s maid, when she found her mistress in a passion\\r\\nupon her return from Susan\\'s, \"I only wondered you did her the honour to\\r\\nset your foot within her doors.  What need have you to trouble her for\\r\\nnews about the Abbey folks, when your own papa has been there all the\\r\\nmorning, and is just come in, and can tell you everything?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara did not know that her father meant to go to the Abbey that\\r\\nmorning, for Attorney Case was mysterious even to his own family about\\r\\nhis morning rides.  He never chose to be asked where he was going, or\\r\\nwhere he had been; and this made his servants more than commonly\\r\\ninquisitive to trace him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara, against whose apparent childishness and real cunning he was not\\r\\nsufficiently on his guard, had often the art of drawing him into\\r\\nconversation about his visits.  She ran into her father\\'s parlour; but\\r\\nshe knew, the moment she saw his face, that it was no time to ask\\r\\nquestions; his pen was across his mouth, and his brown wig pushed oblique\\r\\nupon his contracted forehead.  The wig was always pushed crooked whenever\\r\\nhe was in a brown or rather, a black study.  Barbara, who did not, like\\r\\nSusan, bear with her father\\'s testy humour from affection and gentleness\\r\\nof disposition, but who always humoured him from artifice, tried all her\\r\\nskill to fathom his thoughts, and when she found that it would not do,\\r\\nshe went to tell her maid so, and to complain that her father was so\\r\\ncross there was no bearing him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is true that Attorney Case was not in the happiest mood possible; for\\r\\nhe was by no means satisfied with his morning\\'s work at the Abbey.  Sir\\r\\nArthur Somers, the NEW MAN, did not suit him, and he began to be rather\\r\\napprehensive that he should not suit Sir Arthur.  He had sound reasons\\r\\nfor his doubts.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Arthur Somers was an excellent lawyer, and a perfectly honest man.\\r\\nThis seemed to our attorney a contradiction in terms; in the course of\\r\\nhis practice the case had not occurred; and he had no precedents ready to\\r\\ndirect his proceedings.  Sir Arthur was also a man of wit and eloquence,\\r\\nyet of plain dealing and humanity.  The attorney could not persuade\\r\\nhimself to believe that his benevolence was anything but enlightened\\r\\ncunning, and his plain dealing he one minute dreaded as the masterpiece\\r\\nof art, and the next despised as the characteristic of folly.  In short,\\r\\nhe had not yet decided whether he was an honest man or a knave.  He had\\r\\nsettled accounts with him for his late agency, and had talked about\\r\\nsundry matters of business.  He constantly perceived, however, that he\\r\\ncould not impose upon Sir Arthur; but the idea that he could know all the\\r\\nmazes of the law, and yet prefer the straight road, was incomprehensible.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Case, having paid Sir Arthur some compliments on his great legal\\r\\nabilities, and his high reputation at the bar, he coolly replied, \"I have\\r\\nleft the bar.\"  The attorney looked in unfeigned astonishment, that a man\\r\\nwho was actually making 3,OOO pounds per annum at the bar should leave\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am come,\" said Sir Arthur, \"to enjoy that kind of domestic life in the\\r\\ncountry which I prefer to all others, and amongst people whose happiness\\r\\nI hope to increase.\"  At this speech the attorney changed his ground,\\r\\nflattering himself that he should find his man averse to business, and\\r\\nignorant of country affairs.  He talked of the value of land, and of new\\r\\nleases.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Arthur wished to enlarge his domain, and to make a ride round it.  A\\r\\nmap of it was lying upon the table, and Farmer Price\\'s garden came\\r\\nexactly across the new road for the ride.  Sir Arthur looked\\r\\ndisappointed; and the keen attorney seized the moment to inform him that\\r\\n\"Price\\'s whole land was at his disposal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At my disposal! how so?\" cried Sir Arthur, eagerly; \"it will not be out\\r\\nof lease, I believe, these ten years.  I\\'ll look into the rent roll\\r\\nagain; perhaps I am mistaken.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are mistaken, my good sir, and you are not mistaken,\" said Mr. Case,\\r\\nwith a shrewd smile.  \"In one sense, the land will not be out of lease\\r\\nthese ten years, and in another it is out of lease at this present time.\\r\\nTo come to the point at once, the lease is, ab origine, null and void.  I\\r\\nhave detected a capital flaw in the body of it.  I pledge my credit upon\\r\\nit, sir, it can\\'t stand a single term in law or equity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney observed, that at these words Sir Arthur\\'s eye was fixed\\r\\nwith a look of earnest attention.  \"Now I have him,\" said the cunning\\r\\ntempter to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neither in law nor equity,\" repeated Sir Arthur, with apparent\\r\\nincredulity.  \"Are you sure of that, Mr. Case?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure!  As I told you before, sir, I\\'d pledge my whole credit upon the\\r\\nthing--I\\'d stake my existence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THAT\\'S SOMETHING,\" said Sir Arthur, as if he was pondering upon the\\r\\nmatter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney went on with all the eagerness of a keen man, who sees a\\r\\nchance at one stroke of winning a rich friend, and of ruining a poor\\r\\nenemy.  He explained, with legal volubility and technical amplification,\\r\\nthe nature of the mistake in Mr. Price\\'s lease.  \"It was, sir,\" said he,\\r\\n\"a lease for the life of Peter Price, Susanna his wife, and to the\\r\\nsurvivor or survivors of them, or for the full time and term of twenty\\r\\nyears, to be computed from the first day of May then next ensuing.  Now,\\r\\nsir, this, you see, is a lease in reversion, which the late Sir Benjamin\\r\\nSomers had not, by his settlement, a right to make.  This is a curious\\r\\nmistake, you see, Sir Arthur; and in filling up those printed leases\\r\\nthere\\'s always a good chance of some flaw.  I find it perpetually; but I\\r\\nnever found a better than this in the whole course of my practice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Arthur stood in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear sir,\" said the attorney, taking him by the button, \"you have no\\r\\nscruple of stirring in this business?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little,\" said Sir Arthur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, then, that can be done away in a moment.  Your name shall not\\r\\nappear in it at all.  You have nothing to do but to make over the lease\\r\\nto me.  I make all safe to you with my bond.  Now, being in possession, I\\r\\ncome forward in my own proper person.  SHALL I PROCEED?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No--you have said enough,\" replied Sir Arthur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The case, indeed, lies in a nutshell,\" said the attorney, who had by\\r\\nthis time worked himself up to such a pitch of professional enthusiasm,\\r\\nthat, intent upon his vision of a lawsuit, he totally forgot to observe\\r\\nthe impression his words made upon Sir Arthur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s only one thing we have forgotten all this time,\" said Sir\\r\\nArthur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can that be, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That we shall ruin this poor man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCase was thunderstruck at these words, or rather, by the look which\\r\\naccompanied them.  He recollected that he had laid himself open before he\\r\\nwas sure of Sir Arthur\\'s REAL character.  He softened, and said he should\\r\\nhave had certainly more CONSIDERATION in the case of any but a litigious,\\r\\npig-headed fellow, as he knew Price to be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he be litigious,\" said Sir Arthur, \"I shall certainly be glad to get\\r\\nhim fairly out of the parish as soon as possible.  When you go home, you\\r\\nwill be so good, sir, as to send me his lease, that I may satisfy myself\\r\\nbefore we stir in this business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney, brightening up, prepared to take leave; but he could not\\r\\npersuade himself to take his departure without making one push at Sir\\r\\nArthur about the agency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not trouble you, Sir Arthur, with this lease of Price\\'s,\" said\\r\\nCase; \"I\\'ll leave it with your agent.  Whom shall I apply to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"TO MYSELF, sir, if you please,\" replied Sir Arthur.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe courtiers of Louis the Fourteenth could not have looked more\\r\\nastounded than our attorney, when they received from their monarch a\\r\\nsimilar answer.  It was this unexpected reply of Sir Arthur\\'s which had\\r\\nderanged the temper of Mr. Case, and caused his wig to stand so crooked\\r\\nupon his forehead, and which had rendered him impenetrably silent to his\\r\\ninquisitive daughter Barbara.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having walked up and down his room, conversing with himself, for\\r\\nsome time, the attorney concluded that the agency must be given to\\r\\nsomebody when Sir Arthur should have to attend his duty in Parliament;\\r\\nthat the agency, even for the winter season, was not a thing to be\\r\\nneglected; and that, if he managed well, he might yet secure it for\\r\\nhimself.  He had often found that small timely presents worked\\r\\nwonderfully upon his own mind, and he judged of others by himself.  The\\r\\ntenants had been in the reluctant but constant practice of making him\\r\\ncontinual petty offerings; and he resolved to try the same course with\\r\\nSir Arthur, whose resolution to be his own agent, he thought, argued a\\r\\nclose, saving, avaricious disposition.  He had heard the housekeeper at\\r\\nthe Abbey inquiring, as he passed through the servants, whether there was\\r\\nany lamb to be gotten?  She said that Sir Arthur was remarkably fond of\\r\\nlamb, and that she wished she could get a quarter for him.  Immediately\\r\\nhe sallied into his kitchen, as soon as the idea struck him, and asked a\\r\\nshepherd, who was waiting there, whether he knew of a nice fat lamb to be\\r\\nhad anywhere in the neighbourhood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know of one,\" cried Barbara.  \"Susan Price has a pet lamb that\\'s as\\r\\nfat as fat could be.\"  The attorney easily caught at these words, and\\r\\nspeedily devised a scheme for obtaining Susan\\'s lamb for nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be something strange if an attorney of his talents and standing\\r\\nwas not an over-match for Simple Susan.  He prowled forth in search of\\r\\nhis prey.  He found Susan packing up her father\\'s little wardrobe; and\\r\\nwhen she looked up as she knelt, he saw that she had been in tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How is your mother to-day, Susan?\" inquired the attorney.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Worse, sir.  My father goes to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s a pity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It can\\'t be helped,\" said Susan, with a sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It can\\'t be helped--how do you know that?\" said Case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir, DEAR sir!\" cried she, looking up at him, and a sudden ray of hope\\r\\nbeamed in her ingenuous countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if YOU could help it, Susan?\" said he.  Susan clasped her hands in\\r\\nsilence, more expressive than words.  \"You CAN help it, Susan.\"  She\\r\\nstarted up in an ecstasy.  \"What would you give now to have your father\\r\\nat home for a whole week longer?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anything!--but I have nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but you have, a lamb,\" said the hard-hearted attorney.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My poor little lamb!\" said Susan; \"but what can that do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What good can any lamb do?  Is not lamb good to eat?  Why do you look so\\r\\npale, girl?  Are not sheep killed every day, and don\\'t you eat mutton?\\r\\nIs your lamb better than anybody else\\'s, think you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Susan, \"but I love it better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"More fool you,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It feeds out of hand, it follows me about; I have always taken care of\\r\\nit; my mother gave it to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, say no more about it, then,\" he cynically observed; \"if you love\\r\\nyour lamb better than both your father and your mother, keep it, and good\\r\\nmorning to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stay, oh stay!\" cried Susan, catching the skirt of his coat with an\\r\\neager, trembling hand;--\"a whole week, did you say?  My mother may get\\r\\nbetter in that time.  No, I do not love my lamb half so well.\"  The\\r\\nstruggle of her mind ceased, and with a placid countenance and calm\\r\\nvoice, \"take the lamb,\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is it?\" said the attorney.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Grazing in the meadow, by the river side.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must be brought up before night-fall for the butcher, remember.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall not forget it,\" said Susan, steadily.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon, however, as her persecutor turned his back and quitted the\\r\\nhouse, Susan sat down, and hid her face in her hands.  She was soon\\r\\naroused by the sound of her mother\\'s feeble voice, who was calling Susan\\r\\nfrom the inner room where she lay.  Susan went in; but did not undraw the\\r\\ncurtain as she stood beside the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you there, love?  Undraw the curtain, that I may see you, and tell\\r\\nme;--I thought I heard some strange voice just now talking to my child.\\r\\nSomething\\'s amiss, Susan,\" said her mother, raising herself as well as\\r\\nshe was able in the bed, to examine her daughter\\'s countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you think it amiss, then, my dear mother,\" said Susan, stooping to\\r\\nkiss her--\"would you think it amiss, if my father was to stay with us a\\r\\nweek longer?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Susan! you don\\'t say so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is, indeed, a whole week;--but how burning hot your hand is still.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you sure he will stay?\" inquired her mother.  \"How do you know?  Who\\r\\ntold you so?  Tell me all quick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Attorney Case told me so; he can get him a week\\'s longer leave of\\r\\nabsence, and he has promised he will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless him for it, for ever and ever!\" said the poor woman, joining\\r\\nher hands.  \"May the blessing of heaven be with him!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan closed the curtains, and was silent.  She COULD NOT SAY AMEN.  She\\r\\nwas called out of the room at this moment, for a messenger was come from\\r\\nthe Abbey for the bread-bills.  It was she who always made out the bills,\\r\\nfor though she had not a great number of lessons from the writing-master,\\r\\nshe had taken so much pains to learn that she could write a very neat,\\r\\nlegible hand, and she found this very useful.  She was not, to be sure,\\r\\nparticularly inclined to draw out a long bill at this instant, but\\r\\nbusiness must be done.  She set to work, ruled her lines for the pounds,\\r\\nshillings and pence, made out the bill for the Abbey, and despatched the\\r\\nimpatient messenger.  She then resolved to make out all the bills for the\\r\\nneighbours, who had many of them taken a few loaves and rolls of her\\r\\nbaking.  \"I had better get all my business finished,\" said she to\\r\\nherself, \"before I go down to the meadow to take leave of my poor lamb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was sooner said than done, for she found that she had a great number\\r\\nof bills to write, and the slate on which she had entered the account was\\r\\nnot immediately to be found; and when it was found the figures were\\r\\nalmost rubbed out.  Barbara had sat down upon it.  Susan pored over the\\r\\nnumber of loaves, and the names of the persons who took them; and she\\r\\nwrote and cast up sums, and corrected and re-corrected them, till her\\r\\nhead grew quite puzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table was covered with little square bits of paper, on which she had\\r\\nbeen writing bills over and over again, when her father came in with a\\r\\nbill in his hand.  \"How\\'s this, Susan?\" said he.  \"How can ye be so\\r\\ncareless, child?  What is your head running upon?  Here, look at the bill\\r\\nyou were sending up to the Abbey?  I met the messenger, and luckily asked\\r\\nto see how much it was.  Look at it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan looked and blushed; it was written, \"Sir Arthur Somers, to John\\r\\nPrice, debtor, six dozen LAMBS, so much.\"  She altered it, and returned\\r\\nit to her father; but he had taken up some of the papers which lay upon\\r\\nthe table.  \"What are all these, child?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some of them are wrong, and I\\'ve written them out again,\" said Susan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some of them!  All of them, I think, seem to be wrong, if I can read,\"\\r\\nsaid her father, rather angrily, and he pointed out to her sundry strange\\r\\nmistakes.  Her head, indeed, had been running upon her poor lamb.  She\\r\\ncorrected all the mistakes with so much patience, and bore to be blamed\\r\\nwith so much good humour, that her father at last said, that it was\\r\\nimpossible ever to scold Susan, without being in the wrong at the last.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as all was set right, Price took the bills, and said he would go\\r\\nround to the neighbours, and collect the money himself; for that he\\r\\nshould be very proud to have it to say to them, that it was all earned by\\r\\nhis own little daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan resolved to keep the pleasure of telling him of his week\\'s reprieve\\r\\ntill he should come home to sup, as he had promised to do, in her\\r\\nmother\\'s room.  She was not sorry to hear him sigh as he passed the\\r\\nknapsack, which she had been packing up for his journey.  \"How delighted\\r\\nhe will be when he hears the good news!\" said she, to herself; \"but I\\r\\nknow he will be a little sorry too for my poor lamb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Susan had now settled all her business, she thought she could have\\r\\ntime to go down to the meadow by the river side to see her favourite; but\\r\\njust as she had tied on her straw hat the village clock struck four, and\\r\\nthis was the hour at which she always went to fetch her little brothers\\r\\nhome from a dame-school near the village.  She knew that they would be\\r\\ndisappointed, if she was later than usual, and she did not like to keep\\r\\nthem waiting, because they were very patient, good boys; so she put off\\r\\nthe visit to her lamb, and went immediately for her brothers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Ev\\'n in the spring and playtime of the year,\\r\\n     That calls th\\' unwonted villager abroad,\\r\\n     With all her little ones, a sportive train,\\r\\n     To gather king-cups in the yellow mead,\\r\\n     And prink their heads with daisies.\\r\\n                                        Cowper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dame-school, which was about a mile from the hamlet, was not a showy\\r\\nedifice; but it was reverenced as much by the young race of village\\r\\nscholars as if it had been the most stately mansion in the land; it was a\\r\\nlow roofed, long, thatched tenement, sheltered by a few reverend oaks,\\r\\nunder which many generations of hopeful children had gambolled in their\\r\\nturn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe close shaven green, which sloped down from the hatch-door of the\\r\\nschoolroom, was paled round with a rude paling, which, though decayed in\\r\\nsome parts by time, was not in any place broken by violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place bespoke order and peace.  The dame who governed was well\\r\\nobeyed, because she was just and well beloved, and because she was ever\\r\\nglad to give well earned praise and pleasure to her little subjects.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan had once been under her gentle dominion, and had been deservedly\\r\\nher favourite scholar.  The dame often cited her as the best example to\\r\\nthe succeeding tribe of emulous youngsters.  She had scarcely opened the\\r\\nwicket which separated the green before the schoolroom door from the\\r\\nlane, when she heard the merry voices of the children, and saw the little\\r\\ntroup issuing from the hatchway, and spreading over the green.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, there\\'s Susan!\" cried her two little brothers, running, leaping, and\\r\\nbounding up to her; and many of the other rosy girls and boys crowded\\r\\nround her, to talk of their plays; for Susan was easily interested in all\\r\\nthat made others happy; but she could not make them comprehend, that, if\\r\\nthey all spoke at once it was not possible that she could hear what was\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voices were still raised one above another, all eager to establish\\r\\nsome important observation about ninepins, or marbles, or tops, or bows\\r\\nand arrows, when suddenly music was heard and the crowd was silenced.\\r\\nThe music seemed to be near the spot where the children were standing,\\r\\nand they looked round to see whence it could come.  Susan pointed to the\\r\\ngreat oak-tree, and they beheld, seated under its shade, an old man\\r\\nplaying upon his harp.  The children all approached--at first timidly,\\r\\nfor the sounds were solemn; but as the harper heard their little\\r\\nfootsteps coming towards him, he changed his hand and played one of his\\r\\nmost lively tunes.  The circle closed, and pressed nearer and nearer to\\r\\nhim; some who were in the foremost row whispered to each other, \"He is\\r\\nblind!\"  \"What a pity!\" and \"He looks very poor,--what a ragged coat he\\r\\nwears!\" said others.  \"He must be very old, for all his hair is white;\\r\\nand he must have travelled a great way, for his shoes are quite worn\\r\\nout,\" observed another.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these remarks were made whilst he was tuning his harp, for when he\\r\\nonce more began to play, not a word was uttered.  He seemed pleased by\\r\\ntheir simple exclamations of wonder and delight, and, eager to amuse his\\r\\nyoung audience, he played now a gay and now a pathetic air, to suit their\\r\\nseveral humours.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan\\'s voice, which was soft and sweet, expressive of gentleness and\\r\\ngood nature, caught his ear the moment she spoke.  He turned his face\\r\\neagerly to the place where she stood; and it was observed, that whenever\\r\\nshe said that she liked any tune particularly he played it over again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am blind,\" said the old man, \"and cannot see your faces; but I know\\r\\nyou all asunder by your voices, and I can guess pretty well at all your\\r\\nhumours and characters by your voices.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you so, indeed?\" cried Susan\\'s little brother William, who had\\r\\nstationed himself between the old man\\'s knees.  \"Then you heard MY sister\\r\\nSusan speak just now.  Can you tell us what sort of person she is?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That I can, I think, without being a conjurer,\" said the old man,\\r\\nlifting the boy up on his knee; \"YOUR sister Susan is good-natured.\"  The\\r\\nboy clapped his hands.  \"And good-tempered.\"  \"RIGHT,\" said little\\r\\nWilliam, with a louder clap of applause.  \"And very fond of the little\\r\\nboy who sits upon my knee.\"  \"O right! right! quite right!\" exclaimed the\\r\\nchild, and \"quite right\" echoed on all sides.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how came you to know so much, when you are blind?\" said William,\\r\\nexamining the old man attentively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hush,\" said John, who was a year older than his brother, and very sage,\\r\\n\"you should not put him in mind of his being blind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Though I am blind,\" said the harper, \"I can hear, you know, and I heard\\r\\nfrom your sister herself all that I told you of her, that she was good-\\r\\ntempered and good-natured and fond of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that\\'s wrong--you did not hear all that from herself, I\\'m sure,\"\\r\\nsaid John, \"for nobody ever hears her praising herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did not I hear her tell you,\" said the harper, \"when you first came\\r\\nround me, that she was in a great hurry to go home, but that she would\\r\\nstay a little while, since you wished it so much?  Was not that good-\\r\\nnatured?  And when you said you did not like the tune she liked best, she\\r\\nwas not angry with you, but said, \\'Then play William\\'s first, if you\\r\\nplease,\\'--was not that good-tempered?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" interrupted William, \"it\\'s all true; but how did you find out that\\r\\nshe was fond of me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is such a difficult question,\" said the harper, \"that I must take\\r\\ntime to consider.\"  The harper tuned his instrument, as he pondered, or\\r\\nseemed to ponder:  and at this instant, two boys who had been searching\\r\\nfor birds\\' nests in the hedges, and who had heard the sound of the harp,\\r\\ncame blustering up, and pushing their way through the circle, one of them\\r\\nexclaimed, \"What\\'s going on here?  Who are you, my old fellow?  A blind\\r\\nharper!  Well, play us a tune, if you can play ever a good one--play me--\\r\\nlet\\'s see, what shall he play, Bob?\" added he turning to his companion.\\r\\n\"Bumper Squire Jones.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man, though he did not seem quite pleased with the peremptory\\r\\nmanner of the request, played, as he was desired, \"Bumper Squire Jones\";\\r\\nand several other tunes were afterwards bespoke by the same rough and\\r\\ntyrannical voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little children shrunk back in timid silence, and eyed the brutal boy\\r\\nwith dislike.  This boy was the son of Attorney Case; and as his father\\r\\nhad neglected to correct his temper when he was a child, as he grew up it\\r\\nbecame insufferable.  All who were younger and weaker than himself,\\r\\ndreaded his approach, and detested him as a tyrant.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the old harper was so tired that he could play no more, a lad, who\\r\\nusually carried his harp for him, and who was within call, came up, and\\r\\nheld his master\\'s hat to the company, saying, \"Will you be pleased to\\r\\nremember us?\"  The children readily produced their halfpence, and thought\\r\\ntheir wealth well bestowed upon this poor, good-natured man, who had\\r\\ntaken so much pains to entertain them, better even than upon the\\r\\ngingerbread woman, whose stall they loved to frequent.  The hat was held\\r\\nsome time to the attorney\\'s son before he chose to see it.  At last he\\r\\nput his hand surlily into his waistcoat pocket and pulled out a shilling.\\r\\nThere were sixpennyworth of halfpence in the hat.  \"I\\'ll take these\\r\\nhalfpence,\" said he, \"and here\\'s a shilling for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"God bless you, sir,\" said the lad; but as he took the shilling which the\\r\\nyoung gentleman had slily put INTO THE BLIND MAN\\'S HAND, he saw that it\\r\\nwas not worth one farthing.  \"I am afraid it is not good, sir,\" said the\\r\\nlad, whose business it was to examine the money for his master.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid, then, you\\'ll get no other,\" said young Case, with an\\r\\ninsulting laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It never will do, sir,\" persisted the lad; \"look at it yourself; the\\r\\nedges are all yellow! you can see the copper through it quite plain.\\r\\nSir, nobody will take it from us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s your affair,\" said the brutal boy, pushing away his hand.  \"You\\r\\nmay pass it, you know, as well as I do, if you look sharp.  You have\\r\\ntaken it from me, and I shan\\'t take it back again, I promise you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA whisper of \"that\\'s very unjust,\" was heard.  The little assembly,\\r\\nthough under evident constraint, could no longer suppress their\\r\\nindignation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who says it\\'s unjust?\" cried the tyrant, sternly, looking down upon his\\r\\njudges.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan\\'s little brothers had held her gown fast, to prevent her from\\r\\nmoving at the beginning of this contest, and she was now so much\\r\\ninterested to see the end of it, that she stood still, without making any\\r\\nresistance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is anyone here amongst yourselves a judge of silver?\" said the old man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, here\\'s the butcher\\'s boy,\" said the attorney\\'s son; \"show it to\\r\\nhim.\"  He was a sickly-looking boy, and of a remarkably peaceful\\r\\ndisposition.  Young Case fancied that he would be afraid to give judgment\\r\\nagainst him.  However, after some moments\\' hesitation, and after turning\\r\\nthe shilling round several times, he pronounced, \"that, as far as his\\r\\njudgment went, but he did not pretend to be a downright CERTAIN SURE of\\r\\nit, the shilling was not over and above good.\"  Then to Susan, to screen\\r\\nhimself from manifest danger, for the attorney\\'s son looked upon him with\\r\\na vengeful mien, \"But here\\'s Susan here, who understands silver a great\\r\\ndeal better than I do; she takes a power of it for bread, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll leave it to her,\" said the old harper; \"if she says the shilling is\\r\\ngood, keep it, Jack.\"  The shilling was handed to Susan, who, though she\\r\\nhad with becoming modesty forborne all interference, did not hesitate,\\r\\nwhen she was called upon, to speak the truth:  \"I think that this\\r\\nshilling is a bad one,\" said she; and the gentle but firm tone in which\\r\\nshe pronounced the words, for a moment awed and silenced the angry and\\r\\nbrutal boy.  \"There\\'s another, then,\" cried he; \"I have sixpences and\\r\\nshillings too in plenty, thank my stars.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan now walked away with her two little brothers, and all the other\\r\\nchildren separated to go to their several homes.  The old harper called\\r\\nto Susan, and begged, that, if she was going towards the village, she\\r\\nwould be so kind as to show him the way.  His lad took up his harp, and\\r\\nlittle William took the old man by the hand.  \"I\\'ll lead him, I can lead\\r\\nhim,\" said he; and John ran on before them, to gather king-cups in the\\r\\nmeadow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a small rivulet, which they had to cross, and as a plank which\\r\\nserved for a bridge over it was rather narrow, Susan was afraid to trust\\r\\nthe old blind man to his little conductor; she therefore went on the\\r\\ntottering plank first herself, and then led the old harper carefully\\r\\nover.  They were now come to a gate, which opened upon the high road to\\r\\nthe village.  \"There is the high road straight before you,\" said Susan to\\r\\nthe lad, who was carrying his master\\'s harp; \"you can\\'t miss it.  Now I\\r\\nmust bid you a good evening; for I\\'m in a great hurry to get home, and\\r\\nmust go the short way across the fields here, which would not be so\\r\\npleasant for you, because of the stiles.  Good-bye.\"  The old harper\\r\\nthanked her, and went along the high road, whilst she and her brothers\\r\\ntripped on as fast as they could by the short way across the fields.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Somers, I am afraid, will be waiting for us,\" said Susan.  \"You\\r\\nknow she said she would call at six; and by the length of our shadows I\\'m\\r\\nsure it is late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to their own cottage-door, they heard many voices, and\\r\\nthey saw, when they entered, several ladies standing in the kitchen.\\r\\n\"Come in, Susan; we thought you had quite forsaken us,\" said Miss Somers\\r\\nto Susan, who advanced timidly.  \"I fancy you forgot that we promised to\\r\\npay you a visit this evening, but you need not blush so much about the\\r\\nmatter; there is no great harm done; we have only been here about five\\r\\nminutes; and we have been well employed in admiring your neat garden, and\\r\\nyour orderly shelves.  Is it you, Susan, who keeps these things in such\\r\\nnice order?\" continued Miss Somers, looking round the kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Susan could reply, little William pushed forward, and answered,\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, it is MY sister Susan that keeps everything neat; and she\\r\\nalways comes to school for us, too, which was what caused her to be so\\r\\nlate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because as how,\" continued John, \"she was loth to refuse us the hearing\\r\\na blind man play on the harp.  It was we kept her, and we hopes, ma\\'am,\\r\\nas you ARE--as you SEEM so good, you won\\'t take it amiss.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Somers and her sister smiled at the affectionate simplicity with\\r\\nwhich Susan\\'s little brothers undertook her defence, and they were, from\\r\\nthis slight circumstance, disposed to think yet more favourably of a\\r\\nfamily which seemed so well united.  They took Susan along with them\\r\\nthrough the village.  Many neighbours came to their doors, and far from\\r\\nenvying, they all secretly wished Susan well as she passed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I fancy we shall find what we want here,\" said Miss Somers, stopping\\r\\nbefore a shop, where unfolded sheets of pins and glass buttons glistened\\r\\nin the window, and where rolls of many coloured ribbons appeared ranged\\r\\nin tempting order.  She went in, and was rejoiced to see the shelves at\\r\\nthe back of the counter well-furnished with glossy tiers of stuffs, and\\r\\ngay, neat printed linens and calicoes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Susan, choose yourself a gown,\" said Miss Somers; \"you set an\\r\\nexample of industry and good conduct, of which we wish to take public\\r\\nnotice, for the benefit of others.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shopkeeper, who was father to Susan\\'s friend Rose, looked much\\r\\nsatisfied by this speech, and as if a compliment had been paid to\\r\\nhimself, bowed low to Miss Somers, and then with alertness, which a\\r\\nLondon linen-draper might have admired, produced piece after piece of his\\r\\nbest goods to his young customer--unrolled, unfolded, held the bright\\r\\nstuffs and calendered calicoes in various lights.  Now stretched his arm\\r\\nto the highest shelves, and brought down in a trice what seemed to be\\r\\nbeyond the reach of any but a giant\\'s arm; now dived into some hidden\\r\\nrecess beneath the counter, and brought to light fresh beauties and fresh\\r\\ntemptations.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan looked on with more indifference than most of the spectators.  She\\r\\nwas thinking much of her lamb, and more of her father.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Somers had put a bright guinea into her hand, and had bid her pay\\r\\nfor her own gown; but Susan, as she looked at the guinea, thought it was\\r\\na great deal of money to lay out upon herself, and she wished, but did\\r\\nknow like to ask, that she might keep it for a better purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people are wholly inattentive to the lesser feelings, and incapable\\r\\nof reading the countenances of those on whom they bestow their bounty.\\r\\nMiss Somers and her sister were not of this roughly charitable class.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She does not like any of these things,\" whispered Miss Somers to her\\r\\nsister.  Her sister observed, that Susan looked as if her thoughts were\\r\\nfar distant from gowns.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you don\\'t fancy any of these,\" said the civil shopkeeper to Susan,\\r\\n\"we shall have a new assortment of calicoes for the spring season, soon\\r\\nfrom town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" interrupted Susan, with a smile and a blush; \"these are all pretty,\\r\\nand too good for me, but--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"BUT what, Susan?\" said Miss Somers.  \"Tell us what is passing in your\\r\\nlittle mind.\"  Susan hesitated.  \"Well then, we will not press you, you\\r\\nare scarcely acquainted with us yet; when you are, you will not be\\r\\nafraid, I hope, to speak your mind.  Put this shining yellow counter,\"\\r\\ncontinued she, pointing to the guinea, \"in your pocket, and make what use\\r\\nof it you please.  From what we know, and from what we have heard of you,\\r\\nwe are persuaded that you will make a good use of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think, madam,\" said the master of the shop, with a shrewd, good\\r\\nnatured look, \"I could give a pretty good guess myself what will become\\r\\nof that guinea; but I say nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, that is right,\" said Miss Somers; \"we leave Susan entirely at\\r\\nliberty; and now we will not detain her any longer.  Good night, Susan,\\r\\nwe shall soon come again to your neat cottage.\"  Susan curtsied, with an\\r\\nexpressive look of gratitude, and with a modest frankness in her\\r\\ncountenance, which seemed to say, \"I would tell you, and welcome, what I\\r\\nwant to do with the guinea; but I am not used to speak before so many\\r\\npeople.  When you come to our cottage again you shall know all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Susan had departed, Miss Somers turned to the obliging shopkeeper,\\r\\nwho was folding up all the things he had opened.  \"You have had a great\\r\\ndeal of trouble with us, sir,\" said she; \"and since Susan will not choose\\r\\na gown for herself, I must.\"  She selected the prettiest; and whilst the\\r\\nman was rolling it in paper, she asked him several questions about Susan\\r\\nand her family, which he was delighted to answer, because he had now all\\r\\nopportunity of saying as much as he wished in her praise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No later back, ma\\'am, than last May morning,\" said he, \"as my daughter\\r\\nRose was telling us, Susan did a turn, in her quiet way, by her mother,\\r\\nthat would not displease you if you were to hear it.  She was to have\\r\\nbeen Queen of the May, which in our little village, amongst the younger\\r\\ntribe, is a thing that is thought of a good deal; but Susan\\'s mother was\\r\\nill, and Susan, after sitting up with her all night, would not leave her\\r\\nin the morning, even when they brought the crown to her.  She put the\\r\\ncrown upon my daughter Rose\\'s head with her own hands; and, to be sure,\\r\\nRose loves her as well as if she was her own sister.  But I don\\'t speak\\r\\nfrom partiality; for I am no relation whatever to the Prices--only a\\r\\nwell-wisher, as everyone, I believe, who knows them is.  I\\'ll send the\\r\\nparcel up to the Abbey, shall I, ma\\'am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you please,\" said Miss Somers, \"and, as soon as you receive your new\\r\\nthings from town, let us know.  You will, I hope, find us good customers\\r\\nand well-wishers,\" added she, with a smile; \"for those who wish well to\\r\\ntheir neighbours surely deserve to have well-wishers themselves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA few words may encourage the benevolent passions, and may dispose people\\r\\nto live in peace and happiness; a few words may set them at variance, and\\r\\nmay lead to misery and lawsuits.  Attorney Case and Miss Somers were both\\r\\nequally convinced of this, and their practice was uniformly consistent\\r\\nwith their principles.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now to return to Susan.  She put the bright guinea carefully into the\\r\\nglove with the twelve shillings, which she had received from her\\r\\ncompanions on May day.  Besides this treasure, she calculated that the\\r\\namount of the bills for bread could not be less than eight or nine and\\r\\nthirty shillings; and as her father was now sure of a week\\'s reprieve,\\r\\nshe had great hopes that, by some means or other, it would be possible to\\r\\nmake up the whole sum necessary to pay for a substitute.  \"If that could\\r\\nbut be done,\" said she to herself, \"how happy would my mother be.  She\\r\\nwould be quite stout again, for she certainly is a great deal better,\\r\\nsince I told her that father would stay a week longer.  Ah! but she would\\r\\nnot have blessed Attorney Case, though, if she had known about my poor\\r\\nDaisy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan took the path that led to the meadow by the waterside, resolved to\\r\\ngo by herself, and take leave of her innocent favourite.  But she did not\\r\\npass by unperceived.  Her little brothers were watching for her return,\\r\\nand, as soon as they saw her, they ran after her, and overtook her as she\\r\\nreached the meadow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did that good lady want with you?\" cried William; but, looking up\\r\\nin his sister\\'s face, he saw tears in her eyes, and he was silent, and\\r\\nwalked on quietly.  Susan saw her lamb by the water-side.  \"Who are those\\r\\ntwo men?\" said William.  \"What are they going to do with DAISY?\"  The two\\r\\nmen were Attorney Case and the butcher.  The butcher was feeling whether\\r\\nthe lamb was fat.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan sat down upon the bank in silent sorrow; her little brothers ran up\\r\\nto the butcher, and demanded whether he was going to DO ANY HARM to the\\r\\nlamb.  The butcher did not answer, but the attorney replied, \"It is not\\r\\nyour sister\\'s lamb any longer; it\\'s mine--mine to all intents and\\r\\npurposes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yours!\" cried the children, with terror; \"and will you kill it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the butcher\\'s business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little boys now burst into piercing lamentations.  They pushed away\\r\\nthe butcher\\'s hand; they threw their arms round the neck of the lamb;\\r\\nthey kissed its forehead--it bleated.  \"It will not bleat to-morrow!\"\\r\\nsaid William, and he wept bitterly.  The butcher looked aside, and\\r\\nhastily rubbed his eyes with the corner of his blue apron.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney stood unmoved; he pulled up the head of the lamb, which had\\r\\njust stooped to crop a mouthful of clover.  \"I have no time to waste,\"\\r\\nsaid he; \"butcher, you\\'ll account with me.  If it\\'s fat--the sooner the\\r\\nbetter.  I\\'ve no more to say.\"  And he walked off, deaf to the prayers of\\r\\nthe poor children.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the attorney was out of sight, Susan rose from the bank where\\r\\nshe was seated, came up to her lamb, and stooped to gather some of the\\r\\nfresh dewy trefoil, to let it eat out of her hand for the last time.\\r\\nPoor Daisy licked her well known hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, let us go,\" said Susan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll wait as long as you please,\" said the butcher.  Susan thanked him,\\r\\nbut walked away quickly, without looking again at her lamb.  Her little\\r\\nbrothers begged the man to stay a few minutes, for they had gathered a\\r\\nhandful of blue speedwell and yellow crowsfoot, and they were decking the\\r\\npoor animal.  As it followed the boys through the village, the children\\r\\ncollected as they passed, and the butcher\\'s own son was amongst the\\r\\nnumber.  Susan\\'s steadiness about the bad shilling was full in this boy\\'s\\r\\nmemory; it had saved him a beating.  He went directly to his father to\\r\\nbeg the life of Susan\\'s lamb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was thinking about it, boy, myself,\" said the butcher; \"it\\'s a sin to\\r\\nkill a PET LAMB, I\\'m thinking--any way, it\\'s what I\\'m not used to, and\\r\\ndon\\'t fancy doing, and I\\'ll go and say as much to Attorney Case; but he\\'s\\r\\na hard man; there\\'s but one way to deal with him, and that\\'s the way I\\r\\nmust take, though so be I shall be the loser thereby; but we\\'ll say\\r\\nnothing to the boys, for fear it might be the thing would not take; and\\r\\nthen it would be worse again to poor Susan, who is a good girl, and\\r\\nalways was, as well as she may, being of a good breed, and well reared\\r\\nfrom the first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, lads, don\\'t keep a crowd and a scandal about my door,\" continued\\r\\nhe, aloud, to the children; \"turn the lamb in here, John, in the paddock,\\r\\nfor to-night, and go your ways home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd dispersed, but murmured, and the butcher went to the attorney.\\r\\n\"Seeing that all you want is a good, fat, tender lamb, for a present for\\r\\nSir Arthur, as you told me,\" said the butcher, \"I could let you have\\r\\nwhat\\'s as good or better for your purpose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Better--if it\\'s better, I\\'m ready to hear reason.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe butcher had choice, tender lamb, he said, fit to eat the next day;\\r\\nand as Mr. Case was impatient to make his offering to Sir Arthur, he\\r\\naccepted the butcher\\'s proposal, though with such seeming reluctance,\\r\\nthat he actually squeezed out of him, before he would complete the\\r\\nbargain, a bribe of a fine sweetbread.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime Susan\\'s brothers ran home to tell her that her lamb was\\r\\nput into the paddock for the night; this was all they knew, and even this\\r\\nwas some comfort to her.  Rose, her good friend, was with her, and she\\r\\nhad before her the pleasure of telling her father of his week\\'s reprieve.\\r\\nHer mother was better, and even said she was determined to sit up to\\r\\nsupper in her wicker armchair.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was getting this ready for supper, when little William, who was\\r\\nstanding at the house door, watching in the dusk for his father\\'s return,\\r\\nsuddenly exclaimed, \"Susan! if here is not our old man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the old harper, \"I have found my way to you.  The neighbours\\r\\nwere kind enough to show me whereabouts you lived; for, though I didn\\'t\\r\\nknow your name, they guessed who I meant by what I said of you all.\"\\r\\nSusan came to the door, and the old man was delighted to hear her speak\\r\\nagain.  \"If it would not be too bold,\" said he, \"I\\'m a stranger in this\\r\\npart of the country, and come from afar off.  My boy has got a bed for\\r\\nhimself here in the village; but I have no place.  Could you be so\\r\\ncharitable as to give an old blind man a night\\'s lodging?\"  Susan said\\r\\nshe would step in and ask her mother; and she soon returned with an\\r\\nanswer, that he was heartily welcome, if he could sleep upon the\\r\\nchildren\\'s bed, which was but small.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man thankfully entered the hospitable cottage.  He struck his\\r\\nhead against the low roof, as he stepped over the doorsill.  \"Many roofs\\r\\nthat are twice as high are not half so good,\" said he.  Of this he had\\r\\njust had experience at the house of the Attorney Case, while he had\\r\\nasked, but had been roughly refused all assistance by Miss Barbara, who\\r\\nwas, according to her usual custom, standing staring at the hall door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man\\'s harp was set down in Farmer Price\\'s kitchen, and he\\r\\npromised to play a tune for the boys before they went to bed; their\\r\\nmother giving them leave to sit up to supper with their father.  He came\\r\\nhome with a sorrowful countenance; but how soon did it brighten, when\\r\\nSusan, with a smile, said to him, \"Father, we\\'ve good news for you! good\\r\\nnews for us all!--You have a whole week longer to stay with us; and\\r\\nperhaps,\" continued she, putting her little purse into his hands,--\\r\\n\"perhaps with what\\'s here, and the bread bills, and what may somehow be\\r\\ngot together before a week\\'s at an end, we may make up the nine guineas\\r\\nfor the substitute, as they call him.  Who knows, dearest mother, but we\\r\\nmay keep him with us for ever!\"  As she spoke, she threw her arms round\\r\\nher father, who pressed her to his bosom without speaking, for his heart\\r\\nwas full.  He was some little time before he could perfectly believe that\\r\\nwhat he heard was true; but the revived smiles of his wife, the noisy joy\\r\\nof his little boys, and the satisfaction that shone in Susan\\'s\\r\\ncountenance, convinced him that he was not in a dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they sat down to supper, the old harper was made welcome to his share\\r\\nof the cheerful though frugal meal.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan\\'s father, as soon as supper was finished, even before he would let\\r\\nthe harper play a tune for his boys, opened the little purse, which Susan\\r\\nhad given him.  He was surprised at the sight of the twelve shillings,\\r\\nand still more, when he came to the bottom of the purse, to see the\\r\\nbright golden guinea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did you come by all this money, Susan?\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Honestly and handsomely, that I\\'m sure of beforehand,\" said her proud\\r\\nmother; \"but how I can\\'t make out, except by the baking.  Hey, Susan is\\r\\nthis your first baking?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, no,\" said her father, \"I have her first baking snug here,\\r\\nbesides, in my pocket.  I kept it for a surprise, to do your mother\\'s\\r\\nheart good, Susan.  Here\\'s twenty-nine shillings, and the Abbey bill,\\r\\nwhich is not paid yet, comes to ten more.  What think you of this, wife?\\r\\nHave we not a right to be proud of our Susan?  Why,\" continued he,\\r\\nturning to the harper, \"I ask your pardon for speaking out so free before\\r\\nstrangers in praise of my own, which I know is not mannerly; but the\\r\\ntruth is the fittest thing to be spoken, as I think, at all times;\\r\\ntherefore, here\\'s your good health, Susan; why, by-and-by she\\'ll be worth\\r\\nher weight in gold--in silver at least.  But tell us, child, how came you\\r\\nby all this riches? and how comes it that I don\\'t go to-morrow?  All this\\r\\nhappy news makes me so gay in myself, I\\'m afraid I shall hardly\\r\\nunderstand it rightly.  But speak on, child--first bringing us a bottle\\r\\nof the good mead you made last year from your own honey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan did not much like to tell the history of her guinea-hen--of the\\r\\ngown and of her poor lamb.  Part of this would seem as if she was\\r\\nvaunting of her own generosity, and part of it she did not like to\\r\\nrecollect.  But her mother pressed to know the whole, and she related it\\r\\nas simply as she could.  When she came to the story of her lamb, her\\r\\nvoice faltered, and everybody present was touched.  The old harper sighed\\r\\nonce, and cleared his throat several times.  He then asked for his harp,\\r\\nand, after tuning it for a considerable time, he recollected--for he had\\r\\noften fits of absence--that he sent for it to play the tune he had\\r\\npromised to the boys.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis harper came from a great distance, from the mountains of Wales, to\\r\\ncontend with several other competitors for a prize, which had been\\r\\nadvertised by a musical society about a year before this time.  There was\\r\\nto be a splendid ball given upon the occasion at Shrewsbury, which was\\r\\nabout five miles from our village.  The prize was ten guineas for the\\r\\nbest performer on the harp, and the prize was now to be decided in a few\\r\\ndays.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this intelligence Barbara had long since gained from her maid, who\\r\\noften paid visits to the town of Shrewsbury, and she had long had her\\r\\nimagination inflamed with the idea of this splendid music-meeting and\\r\\nball.  Often had she sighed to be there, and often had she revolved in\\r\\nher mind schemes for introducing herself to some GENTEEL neighbours, who\\r\\nmight take her to the ball IN THEIR CARRIAGE.  How rejoiced, how\\r\\ntriumphant was she, when this very evening, just about the time when the\\r\\nbutcher was bargaining with her father about Susan\\'s lamb, a servant from\\r\\nthe Abbey rapped at the door, and left a card for Mr. and Miss Barbara\\r\\nCase.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There,\" cried Bab, \"_I_ and PAPA are to dine and drink tea at The Abbey\\r\\ntomorrow.  Who knows?  I daresay, when they see that I\\'m not a vulgar\\r\\nperson, and all that; and if I go cunningly to work with Miss Somers, as\\r\\nI shall, to be sure, I daresay, she\\'ll take me to the ball with her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure,\" said the maid; \"it\\'s the least one may expect from a lady\\r\\nwho DEMEANS herself to visit Susan Price, and goes about a-shopping for\\r\\nher.  The least she can do for you is to take you in her carriage, WHICH\\r\\ncosts nothing, but is just a common civility, to a ball.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then pray, Betty,\" continued Miss Barbara, \"don\\'t forget to-morrow, the\\r\\nfirst thing you do, to send off to Shrewsbury for my new bonnet.  I must\\r\\nhave it to DINE IN, at the Abbey, or the ladies will think nothing of me;\\r\\nand Betty, remember the mantua-maker too.  I must see and coax papa to\\r\\nbuy me a new gown against the ball.  I can see, you know, something of\\r\\nthe fashions to-morrow at the Abbey.  I shall LOOK THE LADIES WELL OVER,\\r\\nI promise you.  And, Betty, I have thought of the most charming present\\r\\nfor Miss Somers, as papa says it\\'s good never to go empty-handed to a\\r\\ngreat house, I\\'ll make Miss Somers, who is fond, as her maid told you, of\\r\\nsuch things--I\\'ll make Miss Somers a present of that guinea-hen of\\r\\nSusan\\'s; it\\'s of no use to me, so do you carry it up early in the morning\\r\\nto the Abbey, with my compliments.  That\\'s the thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn full confidence that her present and her bonnet would operate\\r\\neffectually in her favour, Miss Barbara paid her first visit at the\\r\\nAbbey.  She expected to see wonders.  She was dressed in all the finery\\r\\nwhich she had heard from her maid, who had heard from the \\'prentice of a\\r\\nShrewsbury milliner, was THE THING in London; and she was much surprised\\r\\nand disappointed, when she was shown into the room where the Miss\\r\\nSomerses and the ladies of the Abbey were sitting, to see that they did\\r\\nnot, in any one part of their dress, agree with the picture her\\r\\nimagination had formed of fashionable ladies.  She was embarrassed when\\r\\nshe saw books and work and drawings upon the table, and she began to\\r\\nthink that some affront was meant to her, because the COMPANY did not sit\\r\\nwith their hands before them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Miss Somers endeavoured to find out conversation that would interest\\r\\nher, and spoke of walks and flowers and gardening, of which she was\\r\\nherself fond, Miss Barbara still thought herself undervalued, and soon\\r\\ncontrived to expose her ignorance most completely, by talking of things\\r\\nwhich she did not understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who never attempt to appear what they are not--those who do not in\\r\\ntheir manners pretend to anything unsuited to their habits and situation\\r\\nin life, never are in danger of being laughed at by sensible, well bred\\r\\npeople of any rank; but affectation is the constant and just object of\\r\\nridicule.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Barbara Case, with her mistaken airs of gentility, aiming to be\\r\\nthought a woman, and a fine lady, whilst she was, in reality, a child and\\r\\na vulgar attorney\\'s daughter, rendered herself so thoroughly ridiculous,\\r\\nthat the good natured, yet discerning spectators were painfully divided\\r\\nbetween their sense of comic absurdity and a feeling of shame for one who\\r\\ncould feel nothing for herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne by one the ladies dropped off.  Miss Somers went out of the room for\\r\\na few minutes to alter her dress, as it was the custom of the family,\\r\\nbefore dinner.  She left a portfolio of pretty drawings and good prints,\\r\\nfor Miss Barbara\\'s amusement; but Miss Barbara\\'s thoughts were so intent\\r\\nupon the harpers\\' ball, that she could not be entertained with such\\r\\nTRIFLES.  How unhappy are those who spend their time in expectation!\\r\\nThey can never enjoy the present moment.  Whilst Barbara was contriving\\r\\nmeans of interesting Miss Somers in her favour, she recollected, with\\r\\nsurprise, that not one word had yet been said of her present of the\\r\\nguinea-hen.  Mrs. Betty, in the hurry of her dressing her young lady in\\r\\nthe morning, had forgotten it; but it came just whilst Miss Somers was\\r\\ndressing; and the housekeeper came into her mistress\\' room to announce\\r\\nits arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ma\\'am,\" said she, \"here\\'s a beautiful guinea-hen just come, with Miss\\r\\nBarbara Case\\'s compliments to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Somers knew, by the tone which the housekeeper delivered this\\r\\nmessage, that there was something in the business which did not perfectly\\r\\nplease her.  She made no answer, in expectation that the housekeeper, who\\r\\nwas a woman of a very open temper, would explain her cause of\\r\\ndissatisfaction.  In this she was not mistaken.  The housekeeper came\\r\\nclose up to the dressing table, and continued, \"I never like to speak\\r\\ntill I\\'m sure, ma\\'am, and I\\'m not quite sure, to say certain, in this\\r\\ncase, ma\\'am, but still I think it right to tell you, which can\\'t wrong\\r\\nanybody, what came across my mind about this same guinea-hen, ma\\'am; and\\r\\nyou can inquire into it, and do as you please afterwards, ma\\'am.  Some\\r\\ntime ago we had fine guinea-fowls of our own, and I made bold, not\\r\\nthinking, to be sure, that all our own would die away from us, as they\\r\\nhave done, to give a fine couple last Christmas to Susan Price, and very\\r\\nfond and pleased she was at the time, and I\\'m sure would never have\\r\\nparted with the hen with her good-will; but if my eyes don\\'t strangely\\r\\nmistake, this hen, that comes from Miss Barbara, is the selfsame\\r\\nidentical guinea-hen that I gave to Susan.  And how Miss Bab came by it\\r\\nis the thing that puzzles me.  If my boy Philip was at home, maybe, as\\r\\nhe\\'s often at Mrs. Price\\'s (which I don\\'t disapprove), he might know the\\r\\nhistory of the guinea-hen.  I expect him home this night, and if you have\\r\\nno objection, I will sift the affair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The shortest way, I think,\" said Henrietta, \"would be to ask Miss Case\\r\\nherself about it, which I will do this evening.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you please, ma\\'am,\" said the housekeeper, coldly; for she knew that\\r\\nMiss Barbara was not famous in the village for speaking truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nDinner was now served.  Attorney Case expected to smell mint sauce, and,\\r\\nas the covers were taken from off the dishes, looked around for lamb; but\\r\\nno lamb appeared.  He had a dexterous knack of twisting the conversation\\r\\nto his point.  Sir Arthur was speaking, when they sat down to dinner, of\\r\\na new carving knife, which he lately had had made for his sister.  The\\r\\nattorney immediately went from carving-knives to poultry; thence to\\r\\nbutcher\\'s meat.  Some joints, he observed, were much more difficult to\\r\\ncarve than others.  He never saw a man carve better than the gentleman\\r\\nopposite him, who was the curate of the parish.  \"But, sir,\" said the\\r\\nvulgar attorney, \"I must make bold to differ with you in one point, and\\r\\nI\\'ll appeal to Sir Arthur.  Sir Arthur, pray may I ask, when you carve a\\r\\nforequarter of lamb, do you, when you raise the shoulder, throw in salt,\\r\\nor not?\"  This well prepared question was not lost upon Sir Arthur.  The\\r\\nattorney was thanked for his intended present; but mortified and\\r\\nsurprised to hear Sir Arthur say that it was a constant rule of his never\\r\\nto accept of any presents from his neighbours.  \"If we were to accept a\\r\\nlamb from a rich neighbour on my estate,\" said he, \"I am afraid we should\\r\\nmortify many of our poor tenants, who can have little to offer, though,\\r\\nperhaps, they may bear us thorough good-will notwithstanding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the ladies left the dining-room, as they were walking up and down\\r\\nthe large hall, Miss Barbara had a fair opportunity of imitating her keen\\r\\nfather\\'s method of conversing.  One of the ladies observed, that this\\r\\nhall would be a charming place for music.  Bab brought in harps and\\r\\nharpers, and the harpers\\' ball, in a breath.  \"I know so much about it,--\\r\\nabout the ball I mean,\" said she, \"because a lady in Shrewsbury, a friend\\r\\nof papa\\'s, offered to take me with her; but papa did not like to give her\\r\\nthe trouble of sending so far for me, though she has a coach of her own.\"\\r\\nBarbara fixed her eyes upon Miss Somers as she spoke; but she could not\\r\\nread her countenance as distinctly as she wished, because Miss Somers was\\r\\nat this moment letting down the veil of her hat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall we walk out before tea?\" said Miss Somers to her companions; \"I\\r\\nhave a pretty guinea-hen to show you.\"  Barbara, secretly drawing\\r\\npropitious omens from the guinea-hen, followed with a confidential step.\\r\\nThe pheasantry was well filled with pheasants, peacocks, etc., and\\r\\nSusan\\'s pretty little guinea-hen appeared well, even in this high\\r\\ncompany.  It was much admired.  Barbara was in glory; but her glory was\\r\\nof short duration.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as Miss Somers was going to inquire into the guinea-hen\\'s history,\\r\\nPhilip came up, to ask permission to have a bit of sycamore, to turn a\\r\\nnutmeg box for his mother.  He was an ingenious lad, and a good turner\\r\\nfor his age.  Sir Arthur had put by a bit of sycamore, on purpose for\\r\\nhim; and Miss Somers told him where it was to be found.  He thanked her:\\r\\nbut in the midst of his bow of thanks his eye was struck by the sight of\\r\\nthe guinea-hen, and he involuntarily exclaimed, \"Susan\\'s guinea-hen, I\\r\\ndeclare!\"  \"No, it\\'s not Susan\\'s guinea-hen,\" said Miss Barbara,\\r\\ncolouring furiously; \"it is mine, and I have made a present of it to Miss\\r\\nSomers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the sound of Bab\\'s voice, Philip turned--saw her--and indignation,\\r\\nunrestrained by the presence of all the amazed spectators, flashed in his\\r\\ncountenance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter, Philip?\" said Miss Somers, in a pacifying tone; but\\r\\nPhilip was not inclined to be pacified.  \"Why, ma\\'am,\" said he, \"may I\\r\\nspeak out?\" and, without waiting for permission, he spoke out, and gave a\\r\\nfull, true, and warm account of Rose\\'s embassy, and of Miss Barbara\\'s\\r\\ncruel and avaricious proceedings.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara denied, prevaricated, stammered, and at last was overcome with\\r\\nconfusion; for which even the most indulgent spectators could scarcely\\r\\npity her.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Somers, however, mindful of what was due to her guest, was anxious\\r\\nto dispatch Philip for his piece of sycamore.  Bab recovered herself as\\r\\nsoon as he was out of sight; but she further exposed herself by\\r\\nexclaiming, \"I\\'m sure I wish this pitiful guinea-hen had never come into\\r\\nmy possession.  I wish Susan had kept it at home, as she should have\\r\\ndone!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps she will be more careful now that she has received so strong a\\r\\nlesson,\" said Miss Somers.  \"Shall we try her?\" continued she.  \"Philip\\r\\nwill, I daresay, take the guinea-hen back to Susan, if we desire it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you please, ma\\'am,\" said Barbara, sullenly; \"I have nothing more to\\r\\ndo with it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the guinea-hen was delivered to Philip, who set off joyfully with his\\r\\nprize, and was soon in sight of Farmer Price\\'s cottage.  He stopped when\\r\\nhe came to the door.  He recollected Rose and her generous friendship for\\r\\nSusan.  He was determined that she should have the pleasure of restoring\\r\\nthe guinea-hen.  He ran into the village.  All the children who had given\\r\\nup their little purse on May day were assembled on the play-green.  They\\r\\nwere delighted to see the guinea-hen once more.  Philip took his pipe and\\r\\ntabor, and they marched in innocent triumph towards the whitewashed\\r\\ncottage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me come with you--let me come with you,\" said the butcher\\'s boy to\\r\\nPhilip.  \"Stop one minute! my father has something to say to you.\"  He\\r\\ndarted into his father\\'s house.  The little procession stopped, and in a\\r\\nfew minutes the bleating of a lamb was heard.  Through a back passage,\\r\\nwhich led into the paddock behind the house, they saw the butcher leading\\r\\na lamb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is Daisy!\" exclaimed Rose--\"It\\'s Daisy!\" repeated all her companions.\\r\\n\"Susan\\'s lamb!  Susan\\'s lamb!\" and there was a universal shout of joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, for my part,\" said the good butcher, as soon as he could be\\r\\nheard,--\"for my part, I would not be so cruel as Attorney Case for the\\r\\nwhole world.  These poor brute beasts don\\'t know aforehand what\\'s going\\r\\nto happen to them; and as for dying, it\\'s what we must all do some time\\r\\nor another; but to keep wringing the hearts of the living, that have as\\r\\nmuch sense as one\\'s self, is what I call cruel; and is not this what\\r\\nAttorney Case has been doing by poor Susan and her whole family, ever\\r\\nsince he took a spite against them?  But, at anyrate, here\\'s Susan\\'s lamb\\r\\nsafe and sound.  I\\'d have taken it back sooner, but I was off before day\\r\\nto the fair, and am but just come back.  Daisy, however, has been as well\\r\\noff in my paddock as he would have been in the field by the waterside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe obliging shopkeeper, who showed the pretty calicoes to Susan, was now\\r\\nat his door, and when he saw the lamb, and heard that it was Susan\\'s, and\\r\\nlearned its history, he said that he would add his mite; and he gave the\\r\\nchildren some ends of narrow riband, with which Rose decorated her\\r\\nfriend\\'s lamb.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pipe and tabor now once more began to play, and the procession moved\\r\\non in joyful order, after giving the humane butcher three cheers; three\\r\\ncheers which were better deserved than \"loud huzzas\" usually are.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was working in her arbour, with her little deal table before her.\\r\\nWhen she heard the sound of the music, she put down her work and\\r\\nlistened.  She saw the crowd of children coming nearer and nearer.  They\\r\\nhad closed round Daisy, so that she did not see it; but as they came up\\r\\nto the garden gate she saw that Rose beckoned to her.  Philip played as\\r\\nloud as he could, that she might not hear, till the proper moment, the\\r\\nbleating of the lamb.  Susan opened the garden-wicket, and at this signal\\r\\nthe crowd divided, and the first thing that Susan saw, in the midst of\\r\\nher taller friends, was little smiling Mary, with the guinea-hen in her\\r\\narms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come on!  Come on!\" cried Mary, as Susan started with joyful surprise;\\r\\n\"you have more to see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant the music paused, Susan heard the bleating of a lamb, and\\r\\nscarcely daring to believe her senses, she pressed eagerly forward, and\\r\\nbeheld poor Daisy!--she burst into tears.  \"I did not shed one tear when\\r\\nI parted with you, my dear little Daisy!\" said she.  \"It was for my\\r\\nfather and mother.  I would not have parted with you for anything else in\\r\\nthe whole world.  Thank you, thank you all,\" added she, to her\\r\\ncompanions, who sympathized in her joy, even more than they had\\r\\nsympathized in her sorrow.  \"Now, if my father was not to go away from us\\r\\nnext week, and if my mother was quite stout, I should be the happiest\\r\\nperson in the world!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Susan pronounced these words, a voice behind the little listening\\r\\ncrowd cried, in a brutal tone, \"Let us pass, if you please; you have no\\r\\nright to stop up the public road!\"  This was the voice of Attorney Case,\\r\\nwho was returning with his daughter Barbara from his visit to the Abbey.\\r\\nHe saw the lamb, and tried to whistle as he went on.  Barbara also saw\\r\\nthe guinea-hen, and turned her head another way, that she might avoid the\\r\\ncontemptuous, reproachful looks of those whom she only affected to\\r\\ndespise.  Even her new bonnet, in which she had expected to be so much\\r\\nadmired, was now only serviceable to hide her face and conceal her\\r\\nmortification.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad she saw the guinea-hen,\" cried Rose, who now held it in her\\r\\nhands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Philip, \"she\\'ll not forget May day in a hurry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor I neither, I hope,\" said Susan, looking round upon her companions\\r\\nwith a most affectionate smile:  \"I hope, whilst I live, I shall never\\r\\nforget your goodness to me last May day.  Now I\\'ve my pretty guinea-hen\\r\\nsafe once more, I should think of returning your money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No! no! no!\" was the general cry.  \"We don\\'t want the money--keep it,\\r\\nkeep it--you want it for your father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Susan, \"I am not too proud to be obliged.  I WILL keep your\\r\\nmoney for my father.  Perhaps some time or other I may be able to earn--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" interrupted Philip, \"don\\'t let us talk of earning; don\\'t let us\\r\\ntalk to her of money now; she has not had time hardly to look at poor\\r\\nDaisy and her guinea-hen. Come, we must go about our business, and let\\r\\nher have them all to herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd moved away in consequence of Philip\\'s considerate advice:  but\\r\\nit was observed that he was the very last to stir from the garden-wicket\\r\\nhimself.  He stayed, first, to inform Susan that it was Rose who tied the\\r\\nribands on Daisy\\'s head.  Then he stayed a little longer to let her into\\r\\nthe history of the guinea-hen, and to tell her who it was that brought\\r\\nthe hen home from the Abbey.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose held the sieve, and Susan was feeding her long lost favourite,\\r\\nwhilst Philip leaned over the wicket, prolonging his narration.  \"Now, my\\r\\npretty guinea-hen,\" said Susan--\"my naughty guinea-hen, that flew away\\r\\nfrom me, you shall never serve me so again.  I must cut your nice wings;\\r\\nbut I won\\'t hurt you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care,\" cried Philip; \"you\\'d better, indeed you\\'d better let me hold\\r\\nher whilst you cut her wings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this operation was successfully performed, which it certainly could\\r\\nnever have been if Philip had not held the hen for Susan, he recollected\\r\\nthat his mother had sent him with a message to Mrs. Price.  This message\\r\\nled to another quarter of an hour\\'s delay; for he had the whole history\\r\\nof the guinea-hen to tell over again to Mrs. Price, and the farmer\\r\\nhimself luckily came in whilst it was going on, so it was but civil to\\r\\nbegin it afresh; and then the farmer was so rejoiced to see his Susan so\\r\\nhappy again with her two little favourites that he declared he must see\\r\\nDaisy fed himself; and Philip found that he was wanted to hold the jug\\r\\nfull of milk, out of which Farmer Price filled the pan for Daisy?  Happy\\r\\nDaisy! who lapped at his ease, whilst Susan caressed him, and thanked her\\r\\nfond father and her pleased mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Philip,\" said Mrs. Price, \"I\\'ll hold the jug--you\\'ll be late with\\r\\nyour message to your mother; we\\'ll not detain you any longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilip departed, and as he went out of the garden-wicket, he looked up,\\r\\nand saw Bab and her maid Betty staring out of the window, as usual.  On\\r\\nthis, he immediately turned back to try whether he had shut the gate\\r\\nfast, lest the guinea-hen might stray out, and fall again into the hands\\r\\nof the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Barbara, in the course of this day, felt considerable mortification,\\r\\nbut no contrition.  She was vexed that her meanness was discovered, but\\r\\nshe felt no desire to cure herself of any of her faults.  The ball was\\r\\nstill uppermost in her vain, selfish soul. \"Well,\" said she to her\\r\\nconfidante, Betty, \"you hear how things have turned out; but if Miss\\r\\nSomers won\\'t think of asking me to go out with her, I\\'ve a notion I know\\r\\nwho will.  As papa says, it\\'s a good thing to have two strings to one\\'s\\r\\nbow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, some officers, who were quartered at Shrewsbury, had become\\r\\nacquainted with Mr. Case.  They had gotten into some quarrel with a\\r\\ntradesman of the town, and Attorney Case had promised to bring them\\r\\nthrough the affair, as the man threatened to take the law of them.  Upon\\r\\nthe faith of this promise, and with the vain hope that, by civility, they\\r\\nmight dispose him to bring in a REASONABLE bill of costs, these officers\\r\\nsometimes invited Mr. Case to the mess; and one of them, who had lately\\r\\nbeen married, prevailed upon his bride SOMETIMES to take a little notice\\r\\nof Miss Barbara.  It was with this lady that Miss Barbara now hoped to go\\r\\nto the harpers\\' ball.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The officers and Mrs. Strathspey, or, more properly, Mrs. Strathspey and\\r\\nthe officers, are to breakfast here, tomorrow, do you know,\" said Bab to\\r\\nBetty.  \"One of them dined at the Abbey, to-day, and told papa that\\r\\nthey\\'d all come.  They are going out on a party, somewhere into the\\r\\ncountry, and breakfast here on their way.  Pray, Betty, don\\'t forget that\\r\\nMrs. Strathspey can\\'t breakfast without honey.  I heard her say so\\r\\nmyself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, indeed,\" said Betty, \"I\\'m afraid Mrs. Strathspey will be likely to\\r\\ngo without her breakfast here; for not a spoonful of honey have we, let\\r\\nher long for it ever so much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, surely,\" said Bab, \"we can contrive to get some honey in the\\r\\nneighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s none to be bought, as I know of,\" said Betty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But is there none to be begged or borrowed?\" said Bab, laughing.  \"Do\\r\\nyou forget Susan\\'s beehive?  Step over to her in the morning with MY\\r\\nCOMPLIMENTS, and see what you can do.  Tell her it\\'s for Mrs.\\r\\nStrathspey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning Betty went with Miss Barbara\\'s compliments to Susan, to\\r\\nbeg some honey for Mrs. Strathspey, who could not breakfast without it.\\r\\nSusan did not like to part with her honey, because her mother loved it,\\r\\nand she therefore gave Betty but a small quantity.  When Barbara saw how\\r\\nlittle Susan sent, she called her A MISER, and she said she MUST have\\r\\nsome more for Mrs. Strathspey.  \"I\\'ll go myself and speak to her.  Come\\r\\nwith me, Betty,\" said the young lady, who found it at present convenient\\r\\nto forget her having declared, the day that she sucked up the broth, that\\r\\nshe never would honour Susan with another visit.  \"Susan,\" said she,\\r\\naccosting the poor girl, whom she had done everything in her power to\\r\\ninjure, \"I must beg a little more honey from you for Mrs. Strathspey\\'s\\r\\nbreakfast.  You know, on a particular occasion such as this, neighbours\\r\\nmust help one another.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure they should,\" added Betty.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan, though she was generous, was not weak; she was willing to give to\\r\\nthose she loved, but not disposed to let anything be taken from her, or\\r\\ncoaxed out of her, by those she had reason to despise.  She civilly\\r\\nanswered, that she was sorry she had no more honey to spare.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara grew angry, and lost all command of herself, when she saw that\\r\\nSusan, without regarding her reproaches, went on looking through the\\r\\nglass pane in the beehive.  \"I\\'ll tell you what, Susan Price,\" said she,\\r\\nin a high tone, \"the honey I WILL have, so you may as well give it to me\\r\\nby fair means.  Yes or no!  Speak!  Will you give it me or not?  Will you\\r\\ngive me that piece of the honey-comb that lies there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That bit of honey-comb is for my mother\\'s breakfast,\" said Susan;  \"I\\r\\ncannot give it you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t you?\" said Bab, \"then see if I don\\'t take it!\"  She stretched\\r\\nacross Susan for the honey-comb, which was lying by some rosemary leaves\\r\\nthat Susan had freshly gathered for her mother\\'s tea.  Bab grasped, but\\r\\nat her first effort she only reached the rosemary.  She made a second\\r\\ndart at the honey-comb, and, in her struggle to obtain it, she overset\\r\\nthe beehive.  The bees swarmed about her.  Her maid Betty screamed and\\r\\nran away.  Susan, who was sheltered by a laburnum tree, called to\\r\\nBarbara, upon whom the black clusters of bees were now settling, and\\r\\nbegged her to stand still, and not to beat them away.  \"If you stand\\r\\nquietly you won\\'t be stung, perhaps.\"  But instead of standing quietly,\\r\\nBab buffeted and stamped and roared, and the bees stung her terribly.\\r\\nHer arms and her face swelled in a frightful manner.  She was helped home\\r\\nby poor Susan and treacherous Mrs. Betty, who, now the mischief was done,\\r\\nthought only of exculpating herself to her master.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Miss Barbara,\" said she, \"this was quite wrong of you to go and\\r\\nget yourself into such a scrape.  I shall be turned away for it, you\\'ll\\r\\nsee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t care whether you are turned away or not,\" said Barbara; \"I never\\r\\nfelt such pain in my life.  Can\\'t you do something for me?  I don\\'t mind\\r\\nthe pain either so much as being such a fright.  Pray, how am I to be fit\\r\\nto be seen at breakfast by Mrs. Strathspey; and I suppose I can\\'t go to\\r\\nthe ball either to-morrow, after all!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, that you can\\'t expect to do, indeed,\" said Betty, the comforter.\\r\\n\"You need not think of balls; for those lumps and swellings won\\'t go off\\r\\nyour face this week.  That\\'s not what pains me; but I\\'m thinking of what\\r\\nyour papa will say to me when he sees you, miss.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst this amiable mistress and maid were in their adversity reviling\\r\\none another, Susan, when she saw that she could be of no further use, was\\r\\npreparing to depart, but at the house-door, she was met by Mr. Case.  Mr.\\r\\nCase had revolved things in his mind; for his second visit at the Abbey\\r\\npleased him as little as his first, owing to a few words which Sir Arthur\\r\\nand Miss Somers dropped in speaking of Susan and Farmer Price.  Mr. Case\\r\\nbegan to fear that he had mistaken his game in quarrelling with this\\r\\nfamily.  The refusal of his present dwelt upon the attorney\\'s mind; and\\r\\nhe was aware that, if the history of Susan\\'s lamb ever reached the Abbey,\\r\\nhe was undone.  He now thought that the most prudent course he could\\r\\npossibly follow would be to HUSH UP matters with the Prices with all\\r\\nconvenient speed.  Consequently, when he met Susan at his door, he forced\\r\\na gracious smile.  \"How is your mother, Susan?\" said he.  \"Is there\\r\\nanything in our house can be of service to her?\"  On hearing his daughter\\r\\nhe cried out, \"Barbara, Barbara--Bab! come downstairs, child, and speak\\r\\nto Susan Price.\"  But as no Barbara answered, her father stalked upstairs\\r\\ndirectly, opened the door, and stood amazed at the spectacle of her\\r\\nswelled visage.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty instantly began to tell the story of Barbara\\'s mishap her own way.\\r\\nBab contradicted her as fast as she spoke.  The attorney turned the maid\\r\\naway on the spot; and partly with real anger, and partly with feigned\\r\\naffectation of anger, he demanded from his daughter how she dared to\\r\\ntreat Susan Price so ill, \"when,\" as he said, \"she was so neighbourly and\\r\\nobliging as to give you some of her honey?  Couldn\\'t you be content,\\r\\nwithout seizing upon the honey-comb by force?  This is scandalous\\r\\nbehaviour, and what, I assure you, I can\\'t countenance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan now interceded for Barbara; and the attorney, softening his voice,\\r\\nsaid that \"Susan was a great deal too good to her; as you are, indeed,\"\\r\\nadded he, \"to everybody.  I forgive her for your sake.\"  Susan curtsied,\\r\\nin great surprise; but her lamb could not be forgotten, and she left the\\r\\nattorney\\'s house as soon as she could, to make her mother\\'s rosemary tea\\r\\nbreakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Case saw that Susan was not so simple as to be taken in by a few fair\\r\\nwords.  His next attempt was to conciliate Farmer Price.  The farmer was\\r\\na blunt, honest man, and his countenance remained inflexibly\\r\\ncontemptuous, when the attorney addressed him in his softest tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo stood matters the day of the long expected harpers\\' ball.  Miss\\r\\nBarbara Case, stung by Susan\\'s bees, could not, after all her manoeuvres,\\r\\ngo with Mrs. Strathspey to the ball.  The ballroom was filled early in\\r\\nthe evening.  There was a numerous assembly.  The harpers, who contended\\r\\nfor the prize, were placed under the music-gallery at the lower end of\\r\\nthe room.  Amongst them was our old blind friend, who, as he was not so\\r\\nwell clad as his competitors, seemed to be disdained by many of the\\r\\nspectators.  Six ladies and six gentlemen were now appointed to be judges\\r\\nof the performance.  They were seated in a semicircle, opposite to the\\r\\nharpers.  The Miss Somerses, who were fond of music, were amongst the\\r\\nladies in the semicircle; and the prize was lodged in the hands of Sir\\r\\nArthur.  There was now silence.  The first harp sounded, and as each\\r\\nmusician tried his skill, the audience seemed to think that each deserved\\r\\nthe prize.  The old blind man was the last.  He tuned his instrument; and\\r\\nsuch a simple, pathetic strain was heard as touched every heart.  All\\r\\nwere fixed in delighted attention; and when the music ceased, the silence\\r\\nfor some moments continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe silence was followed by a universal buzz of applause.  The judges\\r\\nwere unanimous in their opinions, and it was declared that the old blind\\r\\nharper, who played the last, deserved the prize.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe simple, pathetic air which won the suffrages of the whole assembly,\\r\\nwas his own composition.  He was pressed to give the words belonging to\\r\\nthe music; and at last he modestly offered to repeat them, as he could\\r\\nnot see to write.  Miss Somers\\' ready pencil was instantly produced; and\\r\\nthe old harper dictated the words of his ballad, which he called--\\r\\n\"Susan\\'s Lamentation for her Lamb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Somers looked at her brother from time to time, as she wrote; and\\r\\nSir Arthur, as soon as the old man had finished, took him aside, and\\r\\nasked him some questions, which brought the whole history of Susan\\'s lamb\\r\\nand of Attorney Case\\'s cruelty to light.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney himself was present when the harper began to dictate his\\r\\nballad.  His colour, as Sir Arthur steadily looked at him, varied\\r\\ncontinually; till at length, when he heard the words \"Susan\\'s Lamentation\\r\\nfor her Lamb,\" he suddenly shrunk back, skulked through the crowd, and\\r\\ndisappeared.  We shall not follow him; we had rather follow our old\\r\\nfriend, the victorious harper.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner had he received the ten guineas, his well merited prize, than\\r\\nhe retired to a small room belonging to the people of the house, asked\\r\\nfor pen, ink and paper, and dictated, in a low voice, to his boy, who was\\r\\na tolerably good scribe, a letter, which he ordered him to put directly\\r\\ninto the Shrewsbury post-office.  The boy ran with the letter to the\\r\\npost-office.  He was but just in time, for the postman\\'s horn was\\r\\nsounding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, when Farmer Price, his wife, and Susan, were sitting\\r\\ntogether, reflecting that his week\\'s leave of absence was nearly at an\\r\\nend, and that the money was not yet made up for John Simpson, the\\r\\nsubstitute, a knock was heard at the door, and the person who usually\\r\\ndelivered the letters in the village put a letter into Susan\\'s hand,\\r\\nsaying, \"A penny, if you please--here\\'s a letter for your father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For me!\" said Farmer Price; \"here\\'s the penny then, but who can it be\\r\\nfrom, I wonder?  Who can think of writing to me, in this world?\"  He tore\\r\\nopen the letter; but the hard name at the bottom of the page puzzled him-\\r\\n-\"your obliged friend, Llewellyn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what\\'s this?\" said he, opening a paper that was inclosed in the\\r\\nletter.  \"It\\'s a song, seemingly; it must be somebody that has a mind to\\r\\nmake an April fool of me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is not April, it is May, father,\" said Susan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, let us read the letter, and we shall come to the truth all in good\\r\\ntime.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFarmer Price sat down in his own chair, for he could not read entirely to\\r\\nhis satisfaction in any other, and read as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY WORTHY FRIEND,--I am sure you will be glad to hear that I have had\\r\\ngood success this night.  I have won the ten guinea prize, and for that I\\r\\nam in a great measure indebted to your sweet daughter Susan; as you will\\r\\nsee by a little ballad I inclose for her.  Your hospitality to me has\\r\\nafforded to me an opportunity of learning some of your family history.\\r\\nYou do not, I hope, forget that I was present when you were counting the\\r\\ntreasure in Susan\\'s little purse, and that I heard for what purpose it\\r\\nwas all destined.  You have not, I know, yet made up the full sum for\\r\\nyour substitute, John Simpson; therefore do me the favour to use the five\\r\\nguinea bank note which you will find within the ballad.  You shall not\\r\\nfind me as hard a creditor as Attorney Case.  Pay me the money at your\\r\\nown convenience.  If it is never convenient to you to pay it, I shall\\r\\nnever ask it.  I shall go my rounds again through this country, I\\r\\nbelieve, about this time next year, and will call to see how you do, and\\r\\nto play the new tune for Susan and the dear little boys.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should just add, to set your heart at rest about the money, that it\\r\\ndoes not distress me at all to lend it to you.  I am not quite so poor as\\r\\nI appear to be.  But it is my humour to go about as I do.  I see more of\\r\\nthe world under my tattered garb than, perhaps, I should ever see in a\\r\\nbetter dress.  There are many of my profession who are of the same mind\\r\\nas myself in this respect; and we are glad, when it lies in our way, to\\r\\ndo any kindness to such a worthy family as yours.--So, fare ye well.\\r\\n                      \"Your obliged Friend,\\r\\n                                             \"LLEWELLYN.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan now, by her father\\'s desire, opened the ballad.  He picked up the\\r\\nfive guinea bank note, whilst she read, with surprise, \"Susan\\'s\\r\\nLamentation for her Lamb.\"  Her mother leaned over her shoulder to read\\r\\nthe words; but they were interrupted, before they had finished the first\\r\\nstanza, by another knock at the door.  It was not the postman with\\r\\nanother letter.  It was Sir Arthur and his sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came with an intention, which they were much disappointed to find\\r\\nthat the old harper had rendered vain--they came to lend the farmer and\\r\\nhis good family the money to pay for his substitute.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, since we are here,\" said Sir Arthur, \"let me do my own business,\\r\\nwhich I had like to have forgotten.  Mr. Price, will you come out with\\r\\nme, and let me show you a piece of your land, through which I want to\\r\\nmake a road.  Look there,\" said Sir Arthur, pointing to the spot, \"I am\\r\\nlaying out a ride round my estate, and that bit of land of yours stops\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, sir,\" said Price, \"the land\\'s mine, to be sure, for that matter;\\r\\nbut I hope you don\\'t look upon me to be that sort of person that would be\\r\\nstiff about a trifle or so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The fact is,\" said Sir Arthur, \"I had heard you were a litigious, pig-\\r\\nheaded fellow; but you do not seem to deserve this character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hope not, sir,\" said the farmer; \"but about the matter of the land, I\\r\\ndon\\'t want to take any advantage of your wishing for it.  You are welcome\\r\\nto it; and I leave it to you to find me out another bit of land\\r\\nconvenient to me that will be worth neither more nor less; or else to\\r\\nmake up the value to me some way or other.  I need say no more about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hear something,\" continued Sir Arthur, after a short silence--\"I hear\\r\\nsomething, Mr. Price, of a FLAW in your lease.  I would not speak to you\\r\\nabout it whilst we were bargaining about your land, lest I should over-\\r\\nawe you; but, tell me, what is this flaw?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In truth, and the truth is the fittest thing to be spoken at all times,\"\\r\\nsaid the farmer, \"I didn\\'t know myself what a flaw, as they call it,\\r\\nmeant, till I heard of the word from Attorney Case; and, I take it, a\\r\\nflaw is neither more nor less than a mistake, as one should say.  Now, by\\r\\nreason a man does not make a mistake on purpose, it seems to me to be the\\r\\nfair thing, that if a man finds out his mistake, he might set it right;\\r\\nbut Attorney Case says this is not law; and I\\'ve no more to say.  The man\\r\\nwho drew up my lease made a mistake; and if I must suffer for it, I\\r\\nmust,\" said the farmer.  \"However, I can show you, Sir Arthur, just for\\r\\nmy own satisfaction and yours, a few lines of a memorandum on a slip of\\r\\npaper, which was given me by your relation, the gentleman who lived here\\r\\nbefore, and let me my farm.  You\\'ll see, by that bit of paper, what was\\r\\nmeant; but the attorney says, the paper\\'s not worth a button in a court\\r\\nof justice, and I don\\'t understand these things.  All I understand is the\\r\\ncommon honesty of the matter.  I\\'ve no more to say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This attorney, whom you speak of so often,\" said Sir Arthur, \"you seem\\r\\nto have some quarrel with.  Now, would you tell me frankly what is the\\r\\nmatter between--?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The matter between us, then,\" said Price, \"is a little bit of ground,\\r\\nnot worth much, that is there open to the lane at the end of Mr. Case\\'s\\r\\ngarden, sir, and he wanted to take it in.  Now I told him my mind, that\\r\\nit belonged to the parish, and that I never would willingly give my\\r\\nconsent to his cribbing it in that way.  Sir, I was the more loath to see\\r\\nit shut into his garden, which, moreover, is large enough of all\\r\\nconscience without it, because you must know, Sir Arthur, the children in\\r\\nour village are fond of making a little play-green of it; and they have a\\r\\ncustom of meeting on May day at a hawthorn that stands in the middle of\\r\\nit, and altogether I was very loath to see \\'em turned out of it by those\\r\\nwho have no right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us go and see this nook,\" said Sir Arthur.  \"It is not far off, is\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, sir, just hard by here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they got to the ground, Mr. Case, who saw them walking together, was\\r\\nin a hurry to join them, that he might put a stop to any explanations.\\r\\nExplanations were things of which he had a great dread; but, fortunately,\\r\\nhe was upon this occasion a little too late.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this the nook in dispute?\" said Sir Arthur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; this is the whole thing,\" said Price.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Sir Arthur,\" interposed the politic attorney, with an assumed air\\r\\nof generosity, \"don\\'t let us talk any more about it.  Let it belong to\\r\\nwhom it will, I give it up to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So great a lawyer, Mr. Case, as you are,\" replied Sir Arthur, \"must\\r\\nknow, that a man cannot give up that to which he has no legal title; and\\r\\nin this case it is impossible that, with the best intentions to oblige me\\r\\nin the world, you can give up this bit of land to me, because it is mine\\r\\nalready, as I can convince you effectually by a map of the adjoining\\r\\nland, which I have fortunately safe amongst my papers.  This piece of\\r\\nground belonged to the farm on the opposite side of the road, and it was\\r\\ncut off when the lane was made.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very possibly.  I daresay you are quite correct; you must know best,\"\\r\\nsaid the attorney, trembling for the agency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" said Sir Arthur, \"Mr. Price, you will observe that I now promise\\r\\nthis little green to the children for a play-ground; and I hope they may\\r\\ngather hawthorn many a May day at this their favourite bush.\"  Mr. Price\\r\\nbowed low, which he seldom did, even when he received a favour himself.\\r\\n\"And now, Mr. Case,\" said Sir Arthur, turning to the attorney, who did\\r\\nnot know which way to look, \"you sent me a lease to look over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ye-ye-yes,\" stammered Mr Case.  \"I thought it my duty to do so; not out\\r\\nof any malice or ill-will to this good man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have done him no injury,\" said Sir Arthur, coolly.  \"I am ready to\\r\\nmake him a new lease, whenever he pleases, of his farm, and I shall be\\r\\nguided by a memorandum of the original bargain, which he has in his\\r\\npossession.  I hope I never shall take an unfair advantage of anyone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Heaven forbid, sir,\" said the attorney, sanctifying his face, \"that I\\r\\nshould suggest the taking an UNFAIR advantage of any man, rich or poor;\\r\\nbut to break a bad lease is not taking an unfair advantage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You really think so?\" said Sir Arthur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly I do, and I hope I have not hazarded your good opinion by\\r\\nspeaking my mind concerning the flaw so plainly.  I always understood\\r\\nthat there could be nothing ungentlemanlike, in the way of business, in\\r\\ntaking advantage of a flaw in a lease.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said Sir Arthur, \"you have pronounced judgment undesignedly in\\r\\nyour own case.  You intended to send me this poor man\\'s lease; but your\\r\\nson, by some mistake, brought me your own, and I have discovered a fatal\\r\\nerror in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A fatal error!\" said the alarmed attorney.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Sir Arthur, pulling the lease out of his pocket.  \"Here\\r\\nit is.  You will observe that it is neither signed nor sealed by the\\r\\ngrantor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, you won\\'t take advantage of me, surely, Sir Arthur?\" said Mr. Case,\\r\\nforgetting his own principles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall not take advantage of you, as you would have taken of this\\r\\nhonest man.  In both cases I shall be guided by memoranda which I have in\\r\\nmy possession.  I shall not, Mr. Case, defraud you of one shilling of\\r\\nyour property.  I am ready, at a fair valuation, to pay the exact value\\r\\nof your house and land; but upon this condition--that you quit the parish\\r\\nwithin one month!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAttorney Case was thus compelled to submit to the hard necessity of the\\r\\ncase, for he knew that he could not legally resist.  Indeed he was glad\\r\\nto be let off so easily; and he bowed and sneaked away, secretly\\r\\ncomforting himself with the hope, that when they came to the valuation of\\r\\nthe house and land he should be the gainer, perhaps of a few guineas.\\r\\nHis reputation he justly held very cheap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a scholar; you write a good hand; you can keep accounts, cannot\\r\\nyou?\" said Sir Arthur to Mr. Price, as they walked home towards the\\r\\ncottage.  \"I think I saw a bill of your little daughter\\'s drawing out the\\r\\nother day, which was very neatly written.  Did you teach her to write?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir,\" said Price, \"I can\\'t say I did THAT; for she mostly taught it\\r\\nherself, but I taught her a little arithmetic, as far as I knew, on our\\r\\nwinter nights, when I had nothing better to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your daughter shows that she has been well taught,\" said Sir Arthur;\\r\\n\"and her good conduct and good character speak strongly in favour of her\\r\\nparents.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very good, very good indeed, sir, to speak in this sort of way,\"\\r\\nsaid the delighted father.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I mean to do more than PAY YOU WITH WORDS,\" said Sir Arthur.  \"You\\r\\nare attached to your own family, perhaps you may become attached to me,\\r\\nwhen you come to know me, and we shall have frequent opportunities of\\r\\njudging of one another.  I want no agent to squeeze my tenants, or do my\\r\\ndirty work.  I only want a steady, intelligent, honest man, like you, to\\r\\ncollect my rents, and I hope, Mr. Price, you will have no objection to\\r\\nthe employment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope, sir,\" said Price, with joy and gratitude glowing in his honest\\r\\ncountenance, \"that you\\'ll never have cause to repent your goodness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what are my sisters about here?\" said Sir Arthur, entering the\\r\\ncottage, and going behind his sisters, who were busily engaged in\\r\\nmeasuring an extremely pretty coloured calico.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is for Susan, my dear brother,\" said they.  \"I know she did not keep\\r\\nthat guinea for herself,\" said Miss Somers.  \"I have just prevailed upon\\r\\nher mother to tell me what became of it.  Susan gave it to her father;\\r\\nbut she must not refuse a gown of our choosing this time; and I am sure\\r\\nshe will not, because her mother, I see, likes it.  And, Susan, I hear\\r\\nthat instead of becoming Queen of the May this year, you were sitting in\\r\\nyour sick mother\\'s room.  Your mother has a little colour in her cheeks\\r\\nnow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, ma\\'am,\" interrupted Mrs. Price, \"I\\'m quite well.  Joy, I think, has\\r\\nmade me quite well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" said Miss Somers, \"I hope you will be able to come out on your\\r\\ndaughter\\'s birthday, which, I hear, is the 25th of this month.  Make\\r\\nhaste and get quite well before that day; for my brother intends that all\\r\\nthe lads and lassies of the village shall have a dance on Susan\\'s\\r\\nbirthday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Sir Arthur, \"and I hope on that day, Susan, you will be very\\r\\nhappy with your little friends upon their play-green.  I shall tell them\\r\\nthat it is your good conduct which has obtained it for them; and if you\\r\\nhave anything to ask, any little favour for any of your companions, which\\r\\nwe can grant, now ask, Susan.  These ladies look as if they would not\\r\\nrefuse you anything that is reasonable; and, I think, you look as if you\\r\\nwould not ask anything unreasonable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir,\" said Susan, after consulting her mother\\'s eyes, \"there is, to be\\r\\nsure, a favour I should like to ask; it is for Rose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know who Rose is,\" said Sir Arthur, smiling; \"but, go on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ma\\'am, you have seen her, I believe; she is a very good girl, indeed,\"\\r\\nsaid Mrs. Price.  \"And works very neatly, indeed,\" continued Susan,\\r\\neagerly, to Miss Somers; \"and she and her mother heard you were looking\\r\\nout for someone to wait upon you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Say no more,\" said Miss Somers; \"your wish is granted.  Tell Rose to\\r\\ncome to the Abbey, to-morrow morning, or, rather, come with her yourself;\\r\\nfor our housekeeper, I know, wants to talk to you about a certain cake.\\r\\nShe wishes, Susan, that you should be the maker of the cake for the\\r\\ndance; and she has good things ready looked out for it already, I know.\\r\\nIt must be large enough for everybody to have a slice, and the\\r\\nhousekeeper will ice it for you.  I only hope your cake will be as good\\r\\nas your bread.  Fare ye well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow happy are those who bid farewell to a whole family, silent with\\r\\ngratitude, who will bless them aloud when they are far out of hearing!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do I wish, now,\" said Farmer Price, \"and it\\'s almost a sin for one\\r\\nthat has had such a power of favours done him, to wish for anything more;\\r\\nbut how I DO wish, wife, that our good friend, the harper was only here\\r\\nat this time.  It would do his old, warm heart good.  Well, the best of\\r\\nit is, we shall be able next year, when he comes his rounds, to pay him\\r\\nhis money with thanks, being all the time, and for ever, as much obliged\\r\\nto him as if we kept it.  I long, so I do, to see him in this house\\r\\nagain, drinking, as he did, just in this spot, a glass of Susan\\'s mead,\\r\\nto her very good health.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Susan, \"and the next time he comes, I can give him one of my\\r\\nguinea-hen\\'s eggs, and I shall show my lamb, Daisy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True, love,\" said her mother, \"and he will play that tune and sing that\\r\\npretty ballad.  Where is it? for I have not finished it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rose ran away with it, mother, but I\\'ll step after her, and bring it\\r\\nback to you this minute,\" said Susan.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan found her friend Rose at the hawthorn, in the midst of a crowded\\r\\ncircle of her companions, to whom she was reading \"Susan\\'s Lamentation\\r\\nfor her Lamb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The words are something, but the tune--the tune--I must have the tune,\"\\r\\ncried Philip.  \"I\\'ll ask my mother to ask Sir Arthur to try and find out\\r\\nwhich way that good old man went after the ball; and if he\\'s above\\r\\nground, we\\'ll have him back by Susan\\'s birthday, and he shall sit here--\\r\\njust exactly here by this, our bush, and he shall play--I mean, if he\\r\\npleases--that same tune for us, and I shall learn it--I mean, if I can--\\r\\nin a minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good news that Farmer Price was to be employed to collect the rents,\\r\\nand that Attorney Case was to leave the parish in a month, soon spread\\r\\nover the village.  Many came out of their houses to have the pleasure of\\r\\nhearing the joyful tidings confirmed by Susan herself.  The crowd on the\\r\\nplay-green increased every minute.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" cried the triumphant Philip, \"I tell you it\\'s all true, every word\\r\\nof it.  Susan\\'s too modest to say it herself; but I tell ye all, Sir\\r\\nArthur gave us this play-green for ever, on account of her being so\\r\\ngood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou see, at last Attorney Case, with all his cunning has not proved a\\r\\nmatch for \"Simple Susan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WHITE PIGEON.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little town of Somerville, in Ireland, has, within these few years,\\r\\nassumed the neat and cheerful appearance of an English village.  Mr.\\r\\nSomerville, to whom this town belongs, wished to inspire his tenantry\\r\\nwith a taste for order and domestic happiness, and took every means in\\r\\nhis power to encourage industrious, well behaved people to settle in his\\r\\nneighbourhood.  When he had finished building a row of good slated houses\\r\\nin his town, he declared that he would let them to the best tenants he\\r\\ncould find, and proposals were publicly sent to him from all parts of the\\r\\ncountry.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the best tenants, Mr. Somerville did not, however, mean the best\\r\\nbidders; and many, who had offered an extravagant price for the houses,\\r\\nwere surprised to find their proposals rejected.  Amongst these was Mr.\\r\\nCox, an alehouse keeper, who did not bear a very good character.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please your honour, sir,\" said he to Mr. Somerville, \"I expected, since\\r\\nI bid as fair and fairer for it than any other, that you would have let\\r\\nme the house next the apothecary\\'s.  Was not it fifteen guineas I\\r\\nmentioned in my proposal? and did not your honour give it against me for\\r\\nthirteen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My honour did just so,\" replied Mr. Somerville, calmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And please your honour, but I don\\'t know what it is I or mine have done\\r\\nto offend you.  I\\'m sure there is not a gentleman in all Ireland I\\'d go\\r\\nfurther to sarve.  Would not I go to Cork to-morrow for the least word\\r\\nfrom your honour?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am much obliged to you, Mr. Cox, but I have no business at Cork at\\r\\npresent,\" answered Mr. Somerville, drily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is all I wish,\" exclaimed Mr. Cox, \"that I could find out and light\\r\\nupon the man that has belied me to your honour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No man has belied you, Mr. Cox, but your nose belies you much, if you do\\r\\nnot love drinking a little, and your black eye and cut chin belie you\\r\\nmuch if you do not love quarrelling a little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quarrel!  I quarrel, please your honour!  I defy any man, or set of men,\\r\\nten mile round, to prove such a thing, and I am ready to fight him that\\r\\ndares to say the like of me.  I\\'d fight him here in your honour\\'s\\r\\npresence, if he\\'d only come out this minute, and meet me like a man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Mr. Cox put himself into a boxing attitude, but observing that Mr.\\r\\nSomerville looked at his threatening gesture with a smile, and that\\r\\nseveral people, who had gathered round him as he stood in the street,\\r\\nlaughed at the proof he gave of his peaceable disposition, he changed his\\r\\nattitude, and went on to vindicate himself against the charge of\\r\\ndrinking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And as to drink, please your honour, there\\'s no truth in it.  Not a drop\\r\\nof whisky, good or bad, have I touched these six months, except what I\\r\\ntook with Jemmy M\\'Doole the night I had the misfortune to meet your\\r\\nhonour coming home from the fair of Ballynagrish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this speech Mr. Somerville made no answer, but turned away to look at\\r\\nthe bow window of a handsome new inn, which the glazier was at this\\r\\ninstant glazing.  \"Please your honour, that new inn is not let, I hear,\\r\\nas yet,\" resumed Mr. Cox; \"if your honour recollects, you promised to\\r\\nmake me a compliment of it last Seraphtide was twelvemonth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impossible!\" cried Mr. Somerville, \"for I had no thoughts of building an\\r\\ninn at that time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I beg your honour\\'s pardon but if you\\'d be just pleased to\\r\\nrecollect, it was coming through the gap in the bog meadows, FORENENT\\r\\nThady O\\'Connor, you made me the promise--I\\'ll leave it to him, so I\\r\\nwill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I will not leave it to him, I assure you,\" cried Mr. Somerville; \"I\\r\\nnever made any such promise.  I never thought of letting this inn to\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then your honour won\\'t let me have it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, you have told me a dozen falsehoods.  I do not wish to have you for\\r\\na tenant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, God bless your honour; I\\'ve no more to say, but God bless your\\r\\nhonour,\" said Mr. Cox; and he walked away, muttering to himself, as he\\r\\nslouched his hat over his face, \"I hope I\\'ll live to be revenged on him!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Somerville the next morning went with his family to look at the new\\r\\ninn, which he expected to see perfectly finished; but he was met by the\\r\\ncarpenter, who, with a rueful face, informed him that six panes of glass\\r\\nin the large bow-window had been broken during the night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! perhaps Mr. Cox has broken my windows, in revenge for my refusing to\\r\\nlet him my house,\" said Mr. Somerville; and many of the neighbours, who\\r\\nknew the malicious character of this Mr. Cox, observed that this was like\\r\\none of his tricks.  A boy of about twelve years old, however, stepped\\r\\nforward and said, \"I don\\'t like Mr. Cox, I\\'m sure; for once he beat me\\r\\nwhen he was drunk; but, for all that, no one should be accused\\r\\nwrongfully.  He could not be the person that broke these windows last\\r\\nnight, for he was six miles off.  He slept at his cousin\\'s last night,\\r\\nand he has not returned home yet.  So I think he knows nothing of the\\r\\nmatter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Somerville was pleased with the honest simplicity of this boy, and\\r\\nobserving that he looked in eagerly at the staircase, when the house door\\r\\nwas opened, he asked him whether he would like to go in and see the new\\r\\nhouse.  \"Yes, sir,\" said the boy, \"I should like to go up those stairs,\\r\\nand to see what I should come to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Up with you, then!\" said Mr. Somerville; and the boy ran up the stairs.\\r\\nHe went from room to room with great expressions of admiration and\\r\\ndelight.  At length, as he was examining one of the garrets, he was\\r\\nstartled by a fluttering noise over his head; and looking up, he saw a\\r\\nwhite pigeon, who, frightened at his appearance, began to fly round and\\r\\nround the room, till it found its way out of the door, and flew into the\\r\\nstaircase.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carpenter was speaking to Mr. Somerville upon the landing-place of\\r\\nthe stairs; but, the moment he spied the white pigeon, he broke off in\\r\\nthe midst of a speech about THE NOSE of the stairs, and exclaimed, \"There\\r\\nhe is, please your honour!  There\\'s he that has done all the damage to\\r\\nour bow-window--that\\'s the very same wicked white pigeon that broke the\\r\\nchurch windows last Sunday was se\\'nnight; but he\\'s down for it now; we\\r\\nhave him safe, and I\\'ll chop his head off, as he deserves, this minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stay!  O stay! don\\'t chop his head off:  he does not deserve it,\" cried\\r\\nthe boy, who came running out of the garret with the greatest eagerness--\\r\\n\"_I_ broke your window, sir,\" said he to Mr. Somerville.  \"I broke your\\r\\nwindow with this ball; but I did not know that I had done it, till this\\r\\nmoment, I assure you, or I should have told you before.  Don\\'t chop his\\r\\nhead off,\" added the boy to the carpenter, who had now the white pigeon\\r\\nin his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Mr. Somerville, \"the pigeon\\'s head shall not be chopped off,\\r\\nnor yours either, my good boy, for breaking a window.  I am persuaded by\\r\\nyour open, honest countenance, that you are speaking the truth; but pray\\r\\nexplain this matter to us; for you have not made it quite clear.  How\\r\\nhappened it that you could break my windows without knowing it? and how\\r\\ncame you to find it out at last?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir,\" said the boy, \"if you\\'ll come up here, I\\'ll show you all I know,\\r\\nand how I came to know it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Somerville followed the boy into the garret, who pointed to a pane of\\r\\nglass that was broken in a small window that looked out upon a piece of\\r\\nwaste ground behind the house.  Upon this piece of waste ground the\\r\\nchildren of the village often used to play.  \"We were playing there at\\r\\nball yesterday evening,\" continued the boy, addressing himself to Mr.\\r\\nSomerville, \"and one of the lads challenged me to hit a mark in the wall,\\r\\nwhich I did; but he said I did not hit it, and bade me give him up my\\r\\nball as the forfeit.  This I would not do; and when he began to wrestle\\r\\nwith me for it, I threw the ball, as I thought, over the house.  He ran\\r\\nto look for it in the street, but could not find it, which I was very\\r\\nglad of; but I was very sorry just now to find it myself lying upon this\\r\\nheap of shavings, sir, under this broken window; for, as soon as I saw it\\r\\nlying there, I knew I must have been the person that broke the window;\\r\\nand through this window came the white pigeon.  Here\\'s one of his white\\r\\nfeathers sticking in the gap.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the carpenter, \"and in the bow-window room below there\\'s\\r\\nplenty of his feathers to be seen; for I\\'ve just been down to look.  It\\r\\nwas the pigeon broke THEM windows, sure enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he could not have got in had I not broke this little window,\" said\\r\\nthe boy, eagerly; \"and I am able to earn sixpence a day, and I\\'ll pay for\\r\\nall the mischief, and welcome.  The white pigeon belongs to a poor\\r\\nneighbour, a friend of ours, who is very fond of him, and I would not\\r\\nhave him killed for twice as much money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take the pigeon, my honest, generous lad,\" said Mr. Somerville, \"and\\r\\ncarry him back to your neighbour.  I forgive him all the mischief he has\\r\\ndone me, tell your friend, for your sake.  As to the rest, we can have\\r\\nthe windows mended; and do you keep all the sixpences you earn for\\r\\nyourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s what he never did yet,\" said the carpenter.  \"Many\\'s the sixpence\\r\\nhe earns, but not a halfpenny goes into his own pocket:  it goes every\\r\\nfarthing to his poor father and mother.  Happy for them to have such a\\r\\nson!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"More happy for him to have such a father and mother,\" exclaimed the boy.\\r\\n\"Their good days they took all the best care of me that was to be had for\\r\\nlove or money, and would, if I would let them, go on paying for my\\r\\nschooling now, falling as they be in the world; but I must learn to mind\\r\\nthe shop now.  Good morning to you, sir; and thank you kindly,\" said he\\r\\nto Mr. Somerville.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And where does this boy live, and who are his father and mother?  They\\r\\ncannot live in town,\" said Mr. Somerville, \"or I should have heard of\\r\\nthem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are but just come into the town, please your honour,\" said the\\r\\ncarpenter.  \"They lived formerly upon Counsellor O\\'Donnel\\'s estate; but\\r\\nthey were ruined, please your honour, by taking a joint lease with a man,\\r\\nwho fell afterwards into bad company, ran out all he had, so could not\\r\\npay the landlord; and these poor people were forced to pay his share and\\r\\ntheir own too, which almost ruined them.  They were obliged to give up\\r\\nthe land; and now they have furnished a little shop in this town with\\r\\nwhat goods they could afford to buy with the money they got by the sale\\r\\nof their cattle and stock.  They have the good-will of all who know them;\\r\\nand I am sure I hope they will do well.  The boy is very ready in the\\r\\nshop, though he said only that he could earn sixpence a day.  He writes a\\r\\ngood hand, and is quick at casting up accounts, for his age.  Besides, he\\r\\nis likely to do well in the world, because he is never in idle company,\\r\\nand I\\'ve known him since he was two foot high, and never heard of his\\r\\ntelling a lie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is an excellent character of the boy, indeed,\" said Mr. Somerville,\\r\\n\"and from his behaviour this morning I am inclined to think that he\\r\\ndeserves all your praises.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Somerville resolved to inquire more fully concerning this poor\\r\\nfamily, and to attend to their conduct himself, fully determined to\\r\\nassist them if he should find them such as they had been represented.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, this boy, whose name was Brian O\\'Neill, went to return\\r\\nthe white pigeon to its owner.  \"You have saved its life,\" said the woman\\r\\nto whom it belonged, \"and I\\'ll make you a present of it.\"  Brian thanked\\r\\nher; and he from that day began to grow fond of the pigeon.  He always\\r\\ntook care to scatter some oats for it in his father\\'s yard; and the\\r\\npigeon grew so tame at last that it would hop about the kitchen, and eat\\r\\noff the same trencher with the dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrian, after the shop was shut up at night, used to amuse himself with\\r\\nreading some little books which the schoolmaster who formerly taught him\\r\\narithmetic was so good as to lend him.  Amongst these he one evening met\\r\\nwith a little book full of the history of birds and beasts; he looked\\r\\nimmediately to see whether the pigeon was mentioned amongst the birds,\\r\\nand, to his great joy, he found a full description and history of his\\r\\nfavourite bird.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, Brian, I see your schooling has not been thrown away upon you; you\\r\\nlike your book, I see, when you have no master over you to bid you read,\"\\r\\nsaid his father, when he came in and saw Brian reading his book very\\r\\nattentively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you for having me taught to read, father,\" said Brian.  \"Here I\\'ve\\r\\nmade a great discovery:  I\\'ve found out in this book, little as it looks,\\r\\nfather, a most curious way of making a fortune; and I hope it will make\\r\\nyour fortune, father; and if you\\'ll sit down, I\\'ll tell it to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. O\\'Neill, in hopes of pleasing his son rather than in the expectation\\r\\nof having his fortune made, immediately sat down to listen; and his son\\r\\nexplained to him, that he had found in his book an account of pigeons who\\r\\ncarried notes and letters:  \"and, father,\" continued Brian, \"I find my\\r\\npigeon is of this sort; and I intend to make my pigeon carry messages.\\r\\nWhy should not he?  If other pigeons have done so before him, I think he\\r\\nis as good, and, I daresay, will be as easy to teach as any pigeon in the\\r\\nworld.  I shall begin to teach him to-morrow morning; and then, father,\\r\\nyou know people often pay a great deal for sending messengers; and no boy\\r\\ncan run, no horse can gallop, so fast as a bird can fly; therefore the\\r\\nbird must be the best messenger, and I should be paid the best price.\\r\\nHey, father?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure, to be sure, my boy,\" said his father, laughing; \"I wish you\\r\\nmay make the best messenger in Ireland of your pigeon; but all I beg, my\\r\\ndear boy, is that you won\\'t neglect our shop for your pigeon; for I\\'ve a\\r\\nnotion we have a better chance of making a fortune by the shop than by\\r\\nthe white pigeon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrian never neglected the shop; but in his leisure hours he amused\\r\\nhimself with training his pigeon; and after much patience he at last\\r\\nsucceeded so well, that one day he went to his father and offered to send\\r\\nhim word by his pigeon what beef was a pound in the market of\\r\\nBallynagrish, where he was going.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The pigeon will be home long before me, father; and he will come in at\\r\\nthe kitchen window, and light upon the dresser; then you must untie the\\r\\nlittle note which I shall have tied under his left wing, and you\\'ll know\\r\\nthe price of beef directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pigeon carried his message well; and Brian was much delighted with\\r\\nhis success.  He soon was employed by the neighbours, who were aroused by\\r\\nBrian\\'s fondness of his swift messenger; and soon the fame of the white\\r\\npigeon was spread amongst all who frequented the markets and fairs of\\r\\nSomerville.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one of these fairs a set of men of desperate fortunes met to drink,\\r\\nand to concert plans of robberies.  Their place of meeting was at the\\r\\nale-house of Mr. Cox, the man who, as our readers may remember, was\\r\\noffended by Mr. Somerville\\'s hinting that he was fond of drinking and of\\r\\nquarrelling, and who threatened vengeance for having been refused the new\\r\\ninn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst these men were talking over their scheme, one of them observed,\\r\\nthat one of their companions was not arrived.  Another said, \"No.\"  \"He\\'s\\r\\nsix miles off,\" said another; and a third wished that he could make him\\r\\nhear at that distance.  This turned the discourse upon the difficulties\\r\\nof sending messages secretly and quickly.  Cox\\'s son, a lad of about\\r\\nnineteen, who was one of this gang, mentioned the white carrier-pigeon,\\r\\nand he was desired to try all means to get it into his possession.\\r\\nAccordingly, the next day young Cox went to Brian O\\'Neill, and tried, at\\r\\nfirst by persuasion and afterwards by threats, to prevail upon him to\\r\\ngive up the pigeon.  Brian was resolute in his refusal, more especially\\r\\nwhen the petitioner began to bully him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we can\\'t have it by fair means, we will by foul,\" said Cox; and a few\\r\\ndays afterwards the pigeon was gone.  Brian searched for it in vain--\\r\\ninquired from all the neighbours if they had seen it, and applied, but to\\r\\nno purpose, to Cox.  He swore that he knew nothing about the matter.  But\\r\\nthis was false, for it was he who during the night-time had stolen the\\r\\nwhite pigeon.  He conveyed it to his employers, and they rejoiced that\\r\\nthey had gotten it into their possession, as they thought it would serve\\r\\nthem for a useful messenger.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing can be more shortsighted than cunning.  The very means which\\r\\nthese people took to secure secrecy were the means of bringing their\\r\\nplots to light.  They endeavoured to teach the pigeon, which they had\\r\\nstolen, to carry messages for them in a part of the country at some\\r\\ndistance from Somerville; and when they fancied that it had forgotten its\\r\\nformer habits, and its old master, they thought that they might venture\\r\\nto employ him nearer home.  The pigeon, however, had a better memory than\\r\\nthey imagined.  They loosed him from a bag near the town of Ballynagrish\\r\\nin hopes that he would stop at the house of Cox\\'s cousin, which was on\\r\\nits road between Ballynagrish and Somerville.  But the pigeon, though he\\r\\nhad been purposely fed at this house for a week before this trial, did\\r\\nnot stop there, but flew on to his old master\\'s house in Somerville, and\\r\\npecked at the kitchen window, as he had formerly been taught to do.  His\\r\\nfather, fortunately, was within hearing, and poor Brian ran with the\\r\\ngreatest joy to open the window and to let him in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O, father, here\\'s my white pigeon come back of his own accord,\"\\r\\nexclaimed Brian; \"I must run and show him to my mother.\"  At this instant\\r\\nthe pigeon spread his wings, and Brian discovered under one of its wings\\r\\na small and very dirty looking billet.  He opened it in his father\\'s\\r\\npresence.  The scrawl was scarcely legible; but these words were at\\r\\nlength deciphered:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thare are eight of uz sworn; I send yo at botom thare names.  We meat at\\r\\ntin this nite at my faders, and have harms and all in radiness to brak\\r\\ninto the grate \\'ouse.  Mr. Summervill is to lye out to nite--kip the\\r\\npigeon untill to-morrow.  For ever yours,     MURTAGH COX, JUN.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely had they finished reading this note, than both father and son\\r\\nexclaimed, \"Let us go and show it to Mr. Somerville.\"  Before they set\\r\\nout, they had, however, the prudence to secure the pigeon, so that he\\r\\nshould not be seen by anyone but themselves.  Mr. Somerville, in\\r\\nconsequence of this fortunate discovery, took proper measures for the\\r\\napprehension of the eight men who had sworn to rob his house.  When they\\r\\nwere all safely lodged in the county gaol, he sent for Brian O\\'Neill and\\r\\nhis father; and after thanking them for the service they had done him, he\\r\\ncounted out ten bright guineas upon a table, and pushed them towards\\r\\nBrian, saying, \"I suppose you know that a reward of ten guineas was\\r\\noffered some weeks ago for the discovery of John Mac Dermod, one of the\\r\\neight men whom we have just taken up?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir,\" said Brian; \"I did not know it, and I did not bring that note\\r\\nto you to get ten guineas, but because I thought it was right.  I don\\'t\\r\\nwant to be paid for doing it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s my own boy,\" said his father.  \"We thank you, sir; but we\\'ll not\\r\\ntake the money; I DON\\'T LIKE TO TAKE THE PRICE OF BLOOD.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know the difference, my good friends,\" said Mr. Somerville, \"between\\r\\nvile informers and courageous, honest men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, as to that, please your honour, though we are poor, I hope we are\\r\\nhonest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And, what is more,\" said Mr. Somerville, \"I have a notion that you would\\r\\ncontinue to be honest, even if you were rich.  Will you, my good lad,\"\\r\\ncontinued Mr. Somerville, after a moment\\'s pause--\"will you trust me with\\r\\nyour pigeon a few days?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O, and welcome, sir,\" said the boy, with a smile; and he brought the\\r\\npigeon to Mr. Somerville when it was dark, and nobody saw him.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days afterwards, Mr. Somerville called at O\\'Neill\\'s house, and bid\\r\\nhim and his son follow him.  They followed till he stopped opposite to\\r\\nthe bow-window of the new inn.  The carpenter had just put up a sign,\\r\\nwhich was covered over with a bit of carpeting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go up the ladder, will you?\" said Mr. Somerville to Brian, \"and pull\\r\\nthat sign straight, for it hangs quite crooked.  There, now it is\\r\\nstraight.  Now pull off the carpet, and let us see the new sign.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy pulled off the cover, and saw a white pigeon painted upon the\\r\\nsign, and the name of O\\'Neill in large letters underneath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care you do not tumble down and break your neck upon this joyful\\r\\noccasion,\" said Mr. Somerville, who saw that Brian\\'s surprise was too\\r\\ngreat for his situation.  \"Come down from the ladder, and wish your\\r\\nfather joy of being master of the new inn called the \\'White Pigeon.\\'  And\\r\\nI wish him joy of having such a son as you are.  Those who bring up their\\r\\nchildren well, will certainly be rewarded for it, be they poor or rich.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BIRTHDAY PRESENT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mamma,\" said Rosamond, after a long silence, \"do you know what I have\\r\\nbeen thinking of all this time?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear.--What?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, mamma, about my cousin Bell\\'s birthday; do you know what day it\\r\\nis?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I don\\'t remember.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear mother! don\\'t you remember it\\'s the 22nd of December; and her\\r\\nbirthday is the day after to-morrow?  Don\\'t you recollect now?  But you\\r\\nnever remember about birthdays, mamma.  That was just what I was thinking\\r\\nof, that you never remember my sister Laura\\'s birthday, or-or-or MINE,\\r\\nmamma.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean my dear?  I remember your birthday perfectly well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed! but you never KEEP it, though.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean by keeping your birthday?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, mamma, you know very well--as Bell\\'s birthday is kept.  In the first\\r\\nplace, there is a great dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And can Bell eat more upon her birthday than upon any other day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; nor I should not mind about the dinner, except the mince-pies.  But\\r\\nBell has a great many nice things--I don\\'t mean nice eatable things, but\\r\\nnice new playthings, given to her always on her birthday; and everybody\\r\\ndrinks her health, and she\\'s so happy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But stay, Rosamond, how you jumble things together!  Is it everybody\\'s\\r\\ndrinking her health that makes her so happy? or the new playthings, or\\r\\nthe nice mince pies?  I can easily believe that she is happy whilst she\\r\\nis eating a mince pie, or whilst she is playing; but how does everybody\\'s\\r\\ndrinking her health at dinner make her happy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRosamond paused, and then said she did not know.  \"But,\" added she, \"the\\r\\nNICE NEW playthings, mother!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why the nice new playthings?  Do you like them only because they are\\r\\nNEW?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not ONLY--_I_ do not like playthings ONLY because they are new; but Bell\\r\\nDOES, I believe--for that puts me in mind--Do you know, mother, she had a\\r\\ngreat drawer full of OLD playthings that she never used, and she said\\r\\nthat they were good for nothing, because they were OLD; but I thought\\r\\nmany of them were good for a great deal more than the new ones.  Now you\\r\\nshall be judge, mamma; I\\'ll tell you all that was in the drawer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, Rosamond, thank you, not just now; I have not time to listen to\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well then, mamma, the day after to-morrow I can show you the drawer.  I\\r\\nwant you to judge very much, because I am sure I was in the right.  And,\\r\\nmother,\" added Rosamond, stopping her as she was going out of the room,\\r\\n\"will you--not now, but when you\\'ve time--will you tell me why you never\\r\\nkeep my birthday--why you never make any difference between that day and\\r\\nany other day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And will you, Rosamond--not now, but when you have time to think about\\r\\nit--tell me why I should make any difference between your birthday and\\r\\nany other day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRosamond thought, but she could not find out any reason; besides, she\\r\\nsuddenly recollected that she had not time to think any longer; for there\\r\\nwas a certain work-basket to be finished, which she was making for her\\r\\ncousin Bell, as a present upon her birthday.  The work was at a stand for\\r\\nwant of some filigree-paper, and, as her mother was going out, she asked\\r\\nher to take her with her, that she might buy some.  Her sister Laura went\\r\\nwith them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sister,\" said Rosamond, as they were walking along, \"what have you done\\r\\nwith your half-guinea?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have it in my pocket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear! you will keep it for ever in your pocket.  You know, my godmother\\r\\nwhen she gave it to you, said you would keep it longer than I should keep\\r\\nmine; and I know what she thought by her look at the time.  I heard her\\r\\nsay something to my mother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Laura, smiling; \"she whispered so loud that I could not help\\r\\nhearing her too.  She said I was a little miser.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But did not you hear her say that I was very GENEROUS? and she\\'ll see\\r\\nthat she was not mistaken.  I hope she\\'ll be by when I give my basket to\\r\\nBell--won\\'t it be beautiful?  There is to be a wreath of myrtle, you\\r\\nknow, round the handle, and a frost ground, and then the medallions--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stay,\" interrupted her sister, for Rosamond, anticipating the glories of\\r\\nher work-basket, talked and walked so fast that she had passed, without\\r\\nperceiving it, the shop where the filigree-paper was to be bought.  They\\r\\nturned back.  Now it happened that the shop was the corner house of a\\r\\nstreet, and one of the windows looked out into a narrow lane.  A coach\\r\\nfull of ladies stopped at the door, just before they went in, so that no\\r\\none had time immediately to think of Rosamond and her filigree-paper, and\\r\\nshe went to the window where she saw her sister Laura looking earnestly\\r\\nat something that was passing in the lane.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpposite to the window, at the door of a poor-looking house, there was\\r\\nsitting a little girl weaving lace.  Her bobbins moved as quick as\\r\\nlightning, and she never once looked up from her work.  \"Is not she very\\r\\nindustrious?\" said Laura; \"and very honest, too?\" added she in a minute\\r\\nafterwards; for just then a baker with a basket of rolls on his head\\r\\npassed, and by accident one of the rolls fell close to the little girl.\\r\\nShe took it up eagerly, looked at it as if she was very hungry, then put\\r\\naside her work, and ran after the baker to return it to him.  Whilst she\\r\\nwas gone, a footman in a livery, laced with silver, who belonged to the\\r\\ncoach that stood at the shop door, as he was lounging with one of his\\r\\ncompanions, chanced to spy the weaving pillow, which she had left upon a\\r\\nstone before the door.  To divert himself (for idle people do mischief\\r\\noften to divert themselves) he took up the pillow, and entangled all the\\r\\nbobbins.  The little girl came back out of breath to her work; but what\\r\\nwas her surprise and sorrow to find it spoiled.  She twisted and\\r\\nuntwisted, placed and replaced, the bobbins, while the footman stood\\r\\nlaughing at her distress.  She got up gently, and was retiring into the\\r\\nhouse, when the silver laced footman stopped her, saying, insolently,\\r\\n\"Sit still, child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go to my mother, sir,\" said the child; \"besides, you have spoiled\\r\\nall my lace.  I can\\'t stay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t you?\" said the brutal footman, snatching her weaving-pillow again,\\r\\n\"I\\'ll teach you to complain of me.\"  And he broke off, one after another,\\r\\nall the bobbins, put them into his pocket, rolled her weaving-pillow down\\r\\nthe dirty lane, then jumped up behind his mistress\\' coach, and was out of\\r\\nsight in an instant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor girl!\" exclaimed Rosamond, no longer able to restrain her\\r\\nindignation at this injustice; \"poor little girl!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant her mother said to Rosamond--\"Come, now, my dear, if you\\r\\nwant this filigree paper, buy it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, madam,\" said Rosamond; and the idea of what her godmother and her\\r\\ncousin Bell would think of her generosity rushed again upon her\\r\\nimagination.  All her feelings of pity were immediately suppressed.\\r\\nSatisfied with bestowing another exclamation upon the \"Poor little girl!\"\\r\\nshe went to spend her half-guinea upon her filigree basket.  In the\\r\\nmeantime, she that was called the \"little miser\" beckoned to the poor\\r\\ngirl, and, opening the window, said, pointing to the cushion, \"Is it\\r\\nquite spoiled?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite! quite spoiled! and I can\\'t, nor mother neither, buy another; and\\r\\nI can\\'t do anything else for my bread.\"  A few, but very few, tears fell\\r\\nas she said this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How much would another cost?\" said Laura.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, a great--GREAT deal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"More than that?\" said Laura, holding up her half-guinea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you can buy another with that,\" said Laura, dropping the half-\\r\\nguinea into her hand; and she shut the window before the child could find\\r\\nwords to thank her, but not before she saw a look of joy and gratitude,\\r\\nwhich gave Laura more pleasure probably than all the praise which could\\r\\nhave been bestowed upon her generosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate on the morning of her cousin\\'s birthday, Rosamond finished her work-\\r\\nbasket.  The carriage was at the door--Laura came running to call her;\\r\\nher father\\'s voice was heard at the same instant; so she was obliged to\\r\\ngo down with her basket but half wrapped up in silver paper--a\\r\\ncircumstance at which she was a good deal disconcerted; for the pleasure\\r\\nof surprising Bell would be utterly lost if one bit of the filigree\\r\\nshould peep out before the proper time.  As the carriage went on,\\r\\nRosamond pulled the paper to one side and to the other, and by each of\\r\\nthe four corners.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will never do, my dear,\" said her father, who had been watching her\\r\\noperations.  \"I am afraid you will never make a sheet of paper cover a\\r\\nbox which is twice as large as itself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is not a box, father,\" said Rosamond, a little peevishly; \"it\\'s a\\r\\nbasket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us look at this basket,\" said he, taking it out of her unwilling\\r\\nhands, for she knew of what frail materials it was made, and she dreaded\\r\\nits coming to pieces under her father\\'s examination.  He took hold of the\\r\\nhandle rather roughly; when, starting off the coach seat, she cried, \"Oh,\\r\\nsir! father! sir! you will spoil it indeed!\" said she, with increased\\r\\nvehemence, when, after drawing aside the veil of silver paper, she saw\\r\\nhim grasp the myrtle wreathed handle.  \"Indeed, sir, you will spoil the\\r\\npoor handle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what is the use of THE POOR HANDLE,\" said her father, \"if we are not\\r\\nto take hold of it?  And pray,\" continued he, turning the basket round\\r\\nwith his finger and thumb, rather in a disrespectful manner, \"pray, is\\r\\nthis the thing you have been about all this week?  I have seen you all\\r\\nthis week dabbling with paste and rags; I could not conceive what you\\r\\nwere about.  Is this the thing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir.  You think, then, that I have wasted my time, because the\\r\\nbasket is of no use; but then it is a present for my Cousin Bell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your Cousin Bell will be very much obliged to you for a present that is\\r\\nof no use.  You had better have given her the purple jar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, father! I thought you had forgotten that--it was two years ago; I\\'m\\r\\nnot so silly now.  But Bell will like the basket, I know, though it is of\\r\\nno use.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you think Bell is sillier now than you were two years ago,--well,\\r\\nperhaps that is true; but how comes it, Rosamond, now that you are so\\r\\nwise, that you are fond of such a silly person?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_I_, father?\" said Rosamond, hesitating, \"I don\\'t think I am VERY fond\\r\\nof her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not say VERY fond.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, but I don\\'t think I am at all fond of her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you have spent a whole week in making this thing for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and all my half guinea besides.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet you think her silly, and you are not fond of her at all; and you say\\r\\nyou know this thing will be of no use to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is her birthday, sir; and I am sure she will EXPECT something,\\r\\nand everybody else will give her something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then your reason for giving is because she expects you to give her\\r\\nsomething.  And will you, or can you, or should you, always give, merely\\r\\nbecause others EXPECT, or because somebody else gives?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Always?--no, not always.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, only on birthdays.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRosamond, laughing:  \"Now you are making a joke of me, papa, I see; but I\\r\\nthought you liked that people should be generous,--my godmother said that\\r\\nshe did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So do I, full as well as your godmother; but we have not yet quite\\r\\nsettled what it is to be generous.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why is it not generous to make presents?\" said Rosamond.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the question which it would take up a great deal of time to\\r\\nanswer.  But, for instance, to make a present of a thing that you know\\r\\ncan be of no use to a person you neither love nor esteem, because it is\\r\\nher birthday, and because everybody gives her something, and because she\\r\\nexpects something, and because your godmother says she likes that people\\r\\nshould be generous, seems to me, my dear Rosamond, to be, since I must\\r\\nsay it, rather more like folly than generosity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRosamond looked down upon the basket, and was silent.  \"Then I am a fool,\\r\\nam I?\" said she looking up at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because you have made ONE mistake?  No. If you have sense enough to see\\r\\nyour own mistakes, and can afterwards avoid them, you will never be a\\r\\nfool.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the carriage stopped, and Rosamond recollected that the basket was\\r\\nuncovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow we must observe, that Rosamond\\'s father had not been too severe upon\\r\\nBell when he called her a silly girl.  From her infancy she had been\\r\\nhumoured; and at eight years old she had the misfortune to be a spoiled\\r\\nchild.  She was idle, fretful, and selfish; so that nothing could make\\r\\nher happy.  On her birthday she expected, however, to be perfectly happy.\\r\\nEverybody in the house tried to please her, and they succeeded so well,\\r\\nthat between breakfast and dinner she had only six fits of crying.  The\\r\\ncause of five of these fits no one could discover:  but the last, and\\r\\nmost lamentable, was occasioned by a disappointment about a worked muslin\\r\\nfrock; and accordingly, at dressing time, her maid brought it to her,\\r\\nexclaiming, \"See here, miss, what your mamma has sent you on your\\r\\nbirthday.  Here\\'s a frock fit for a queen--if it had but lace round the\\r\\ncuffs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why has not it lace around the cuffs? mamma said it should.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but mistress was disappointed about the lace; it is not come home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not come home, indeed! and didn\\'t they know it was my birthday?  But\\r\\nthen I say I won\\'t wear it without the lace--I can\\'t wear it without the\\r\\nlace, and I won\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lace, however, could not be had; and Bell at length submitted to let\\r\\nthe frock be put on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Miss Bell, dry your eyes,\" said the maid who educated her; \"dry\\r\\nyour eyes, and I\\'ll tell you something that will please you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, then?\" said the child, pouting and sobbing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why--but you must not tell that I told you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,--but if I am asked?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, if you are asked, you must tell the truth, to be sure.  So I\\'ll\\r\\nhold my tongue, miss.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, tell me, though, and I\\'ll never tell--if I AM asked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" said the maid, \"your cousin Rosamond is come, and has\\r\\nbrought you the most BEAUTIFULLEST thing you ever saw in your life; but\\r\\nyou are not to know anything about it till after dinner, because she\\r\\nwants to surprise you; and mistress has put it into her wardrobe till\\r\\nafter dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Till after dinner!\" repeated Bell, impatiently; \"I can\\'t wait till then;\\r\\nI must see it this minute.\"  The maid refused her several times, till\\r\\nBell burst into another fit of crying, and the maid, fearing that her\\r\\nmistress would be angry with HER, if Bell\\'s eyes were red at dinner time,\\r\\nconsented to show her the basket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How pretty!--but let me have it in my own hands,\" said Bell, as the maid\\r\\nheld the basket up out of her reach.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, you must not touch it; for if you should spoil it, what would\\r\\nbecome of me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Become of you, indeed!\" exclaimed the spoiled child, who never\\r\\nconsidered anything but her own immediate gratification--\"Become of YOU,\\r\\nindeed! what signifies that--I sha\\'n\\'t spoil it; and I will have it in my\\r\\nown hands.  If you don\\'t hold it down for me directly, I\\'ll tell that you\\r\\nshowed it to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you won\\'t snatch it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, I won\\'t indeed,\" said Bell; but she had learned from her maid a\\r\\ntotal disregard of truth.  She snatched the basket the moment it was\\r\\nwithin her reach.  A struggle ensued, in which the handle and lid were\\r\\ntorn off, and one of the medallions crushed inwards, before the little\\r\\nfury returned to her senses.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalmed at this sight, the next question was, how she should conceal the\\r\\nmischief which she had done.  After many attempts, the handle and lid\\r\\nwere replaced; the basket was put exactly in the same spot in which it\\r\\nhad stood before, and the maid charged the child, \"TO LOOK AS IF NOTHING\\r\\nWAS THE MATTER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hope that both children and parents will here pause for a moment to\\r\\nreflect.  The habits of tyranny, meanness, and falsehood, which children\\r\\nacquire from living with bad servants, are scarcely ever conquered in the\\r\\nwhole course of their future lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter shutting up the basket they left the room, and in the adjoining\\r\\npassage they found a poor girl waiting with a small parcel in her hand.\\r\\n\"What\\'s your business?\" said the maid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have brought home the lace, madam, that was bespoke for the young\\r\\nlady.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you have, have you, at last?\" said Bell; \"and pray why didn\\'t you\\r\\nbring it sooner?\"  The girl was going to answer, but the maid interrupted\\r\\nher, saying--\"Come, come, none of your excuses; you are a little idle,\\r\\ngood-for-nothing thing, to disappoint Miss Bell upon her birthday.  But\\r\\nnow you have brought it, let us look at it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little girl gave the lace without reply, and the maid desired her to\\r\\ngo about her business, and not to expect to be paid; for that her\\r\\nmistress could not see anybody, BECAUSE she was in a room full of\\r\\ncompany.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I call again, madam, this afternoon?\" said the child, timidly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord bless my stars!\" replied the maid, \"what makes people so poor, I\\r\\nWONDERS!  I wish mistress would buy her lace at the warehouse, as I told\\r\\nher, and not of these folks.  Call again! yes, to be sure.  I believe\\r\\nyou\\'d call, call, call twenty times for twopence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever ungraciously the permission to call again was granted, it was\\r\\nreceived with gratitude.  The little girl departed with a cheerful\\r\\ncountenance; and Bell teazed her maid till she got her to sew the long\\r\\nwished-for lace upon her cuffs.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunate Bell!--All dinner time passed, and people were so hungry, so\\r\\nbusy, or so stupid, that not an eye observed her favourite piece of\\r\\nfinery.  Till at length she was no longer able to conceal her impatience,\\r\\nand turning to Laura, who sat next to her, she said, \"You have no lace\\r\\nupon your cuffs.  Look how beautiful mine is!--is not it?  Don\\'t you wish\\r\\nyour mamma could afford to give some like it?  But you can\\'t get any if\\r\\nshe would, for this was made on purpose for me on my birthday, and nobody\\r\\ncan get a bit more anywhere, if they would give the world for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But cannot the person who made it,\" said Laura, \"make any more like it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, no!\" cried Bell; for she had already learned, either from her\\r\\nmaid or her mother, the mean pride which values things not for being\\r\\nreally pretty or useful, but for being such as nobody else can procure.\\r\\n\"Nobody can get any like it, I say,\" repeated Bell; \"nobody in all London\\r\\ncan make it but one person, and that person will never make a bit for\\r\\nanybody but me, I am sure.  Mamma won\\'t let her, if I ask her not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well,\" said Laura, coolly, \"I do not want any of it; you need not\\r\\nbe so violent:  I assure you that I don\\'t want any of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but you do, though,\" said Bell, more angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed,\" said Laura, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do, in the bottom of your heart; but you say you don\\'t to plague me,\\r\\nI know,\" cried Bell, swelling with disappointed vanity.  \"It is pretty\\r\\nfor all that, and it cost a great deal of money too, and nobody shall\\r\\nhave any like it, if they cried their eyes out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLaura received this declaration in silence--Rosamond smiled; and at her\\r\\nsmile the ill-suppressed rage of the spoiled child burst forth into the\\r\\nseventh and loudest fit of crying which had yet been heard on her\\r\\nbirthday.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter, my pet?\" cried her mother; \"come to me, and tell me\\r\\nwhat\\'s the matter.\"  Bell ran roaring to her mother; but no otherwise\\r\\nexplained the cause of her sorrow than by tearing the fine lace with\\r\\nfrantic gestures from her cuffs, and throwing the fragments into her\\r\\nmother\\'s lap.  \"Oh! the lace, child!--are you mad?\" said her mother,\\r\\ncatching hold of both her hands.  \"Your beautiful lace, my dear love--do\\r\\nyou know how much it cost?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t care how much it cost--it is not beautiful, and I\\'ll have none\\r\\nof it,\" replied Bell, sobbing; \"for it is not beautiful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is beautiful,\" retorted her mother; \"I chose the pattern myself.\\r\\nWho has put it into your head, child, to dislike it?  Was it Nancy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, not Nancy, but THEM, mamma,\" said Bell, pointing to Laura and\\r\\nRosamond.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, fie! don\\'t POINT,\" said her mother, putting down her stubborn\\r\\nfinger; \"nor say THEM, like Nancy; I am sure you misunderstood.  Miss\\r\\nLaura, I am sure, did not mean any such thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, madam; and I did not say any such thing, that I recollect,\" said\\r\\nLaura, gently.  \"Oh, no, indeed!\" cried Rosamond, warmly, rising in her\\r\\nsister\\'s defence.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo defence or explanation, however, was to be heard, for everybody had\\r\\nnow gathered round Bell, to dry her tears, and to comfort her for the\\r\\nmischief she had done to her own cuffs.  They succeeded so well, that in\\r\\nabout a quarter of an hour the young lady\\'s eyes, and the reddened arches\\r\\nover her eyebrows came to their natural colour; and the business being\\r\\nthus happily hushed up, the mother, as a reward to her daughter for her\\r\\ngood humour, begged that Rosamond would now be so good as to produce her\\r\\n\"charming present.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRosamond, followed by all the company, amongst whom, to her great joy,\\r\\nwas her godmother, proceeded to the dressing room.  \"Now I am sure,\"\\r\\nthought she, \"Bell will be surprised, and my godmother will see she was\\r\\nright about my generosity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doors of the wardrobe were opened with due ceremony, and the filigree\\r\\nbasket appeared in all its glory.  \"Well, this is a charming present,\\r\\nindeed!\" said the godmother, who was one of the company; \"MY Rosamond\\r\\nknows how to make presents.\"  And as she spoke, she took hold of the\\r\\nbasket, to lift it down to the admiring audience.  Scarcely had she\\r\\ntouched it, when, lo! the basket fell to the ground, and only the handle\\r\\nremained in her hand.  All eyes were fixed upon the wreck.  Exclamations\\r\\nof sorrow were heard in various tones; and \"Who can have done this?\" was\\r\\nall that Rosamond could say.  Bell stood in sullen silence, which she\\r\\nobstinately preserved in the midst of the inquiries that were made about\\r\\nthe disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the servants were summoned, and amongst them, Nancy, Miss\\r\\nBell\\'s maid and governess.  She affected much surprise when she saw what\\r\\nhad befallen the basket, and declared that she knew nothing of the\\r\\nmatter, but that she had seen her mistress in the morning put it quite\\r\\nsafe into the wardrobe; and that, for her part, she had never touched it,\\r\\nor thought of touching it, in her born days.  \"Nor Miss Bell, neither,\\r\\nma\\'am,--I can answer for her; for she never knew of its being there,\\r\\nbecause I never so much as mentioned it to her, that there was such a\\r\\nthing in the house, because I knew Miss Rosamond wanted to surprise her\\r\\nwith the secret; so I never mentioned a sentence of it--did I, Miss\\r\\nBell?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBell, putting on the deceitful look which her maid had taught her,\\r\\nanswered boldly, \"NO;\" but she had hold of Rosamond\\'s hand, and at the\\r\\ninstant she uttered this falsehood she squeezed it terribly.  \"Why do you\\r\\nsqueeze my hand so?\" said Rosamond, in a low voice; \"what are you afraid\\r\\nof?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Afraid of!\" cried Bell, turning angrily; \"I\\'m not afraid of anything,--\\r\\nI\\'ve nothing to be afraid about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, I did not say you had,\" whispered Rosamond; \"but only if you did by\\r\\naccident--you know what I mean--I should not be angry if you did--only\\r\\nsay so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say I did not!\" cried Bell, furiously; \"Mamma, mamma!  Nancy! my\\r\\ncousin Rosamond won\\'t believe me!  That\\'s very hard.  It\\'s very rude, and\\r\\nI won\\'t bear it--I won\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be angry, love.  Don\\'t,\" said the maid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nobody suspects you, darling,\" said her mother; \"but she has too much\\r\\nsensibility.  Don\\'t cry, love; nobody suspected you.  But you know,\"\\r\\ncontinued she, turning to the maid, \"somebody must have done this, and I\\r\\nmust know how it was done.  Miss Rosamond\\'s charming present must not be\\r\\nspoiled in this way, in my house, without my taking proper notice of it.\\r\\nI assure you I am very angry about it, Rosamond.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRosamond did not rejoice in her anger, and had nearly made a sad mistake\\r\\nby speaking aloud her thoughts--\"I WAS VERY FOOLISH--\" she began and\\r\\nstopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ma\\'am,\" cried the maid, suddenly, \"I\\'ll venture to say I know who did\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who?\" said everyone, eagerly.  \"Who?\" said Bell, trembling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, miss, don\\'t you recollect that little girl with the lace, that we\\r\\nsaw peeping about in the passage?  I\\'m sure she must have done it; for\\r\\nhere she was by herself half an hour or more, and not another creature\\r\\nhas been in mistress\\' dressing-room, to my certain knowledge, since\\r\\nmorning.  Those sort of people have so much curiosity.  I\\'m sure she must\\r\\nhave been meddling with it,\" added the maid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, that\\'s the thing,\" said the mistress, decidedly.  \"Well, Miss\\r\\nRosamond, for your comfort she shall never come into my house again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that would not comfort me at all,\" said Rosamond; \"besides, we are\\r\\nnot sure that she did it, and if--\"  A single knock at the door was heard\\r\\nat this instant.  It was the little girl, who came to be paid for her\\r\\nlace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Call her in,\" said the lady of the house; \"let us see her directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maid, who was afraid that the girl\\'s innocence would appear if she\\r\\nwere produced, hesitated; but upon her mistress repeating her commands,\\r\\nshe was forced to obey.  The girl came in with a look of simplicity; but\\r\\nwhen she saw a room full of company she was a little abashed.  Rosamond\\r\\nand Laura looked at her and one another with surprise, for it was the\\r\\nsame little girl whom they had seen weaving lace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is not it she?\" whispered Rosamond to her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it is; but hush,\" said Laura, \"she does not know us.  Don\\'t say a\\r\\nword, let us hear what she will say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLaura got behind the rest of the company as she spoke, so that the little\\r\\ngirl could not see her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vastly well!\" said Bell\\'s mother; \"I am waiting to see how long you will\\r\\nhave the assurance to stand there with that innocent look.  Did you ever\\r\\nsee that basket before?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am,\" said the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YES, MA\\'AM!\" cried the maid; \"and what else do you know about it?  You\\r\\nhad better confess it at once, and mistress, perhaps, will say no more\\r\\nabout it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, do confess it,\" added Bell, earnestly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Confess what, madam?\" said the little girl; \"I never touched the basket,\\r\\nmadam.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You never TOUCHED it; but you confess,\" interrupted Bell\\'s mother, \"that\\r\\nyou DID SEE it before.  And, pray, how came you to see it?  You must have\\r\\nopened my wardrobe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, ma\\'am,\" said the little girl; \"but I was waiting in the\\r\\npassage, ma\\'am, and this door was partly open; and looking at the maid,\\r\\nyou know, I could not help seeing it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, how could you see through the doors of my wardrobe?\" rejoined the\\r\\nlady.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maid, frightened, pulled the little girl by the sleeve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Answer me,\" said the lady, \"where did you see this basket?\"  Another\\r\\nstronger pull.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw it, madam, in her hands,\" looking at the maid; \"and--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and what became of it afterwards?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ma\\'am\"--hesitating--\"miss pulled, and by accident--I believe, I saw,\\r\\nma\\'am--miss, you know what I saw.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know--I do not know; and if I did, you had no business there;\\r\\nand mamma won\\'t believe you, I am sure.\"  Everybody else, however, did\\r\\nbelieve; and their eyes were fixed upon Bell in a manner which made her\\r\\nfeel rather ashamed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you all look at me so for?  Why do you all look so?  And am I to\\r\\nbe put to shame on my birthday?\" cried she, bursting into a roar of\\r\\npassion; \"and all for this nasty thing!\" added she, pushing away the\\r\\nremains of the basket, and looking angrily at Rosamond.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bell!  Bell!  O, fie! fie!--Now I am ashamed of you; that\\'s quite rude\\r\\nto your cousin,\" said her mother, who was more shocked at her daughter\\'s\\r\\nwant of politeness than at her falsehood.  \"Take her away, Nancy, till\\r\\nshe has done crying,\" added she to the maid, who accordingly carried off\\r\\nher pupil.\\r\\n\\r\\nRosamond, during this scene, especially at the moment when her present\\r\\nwas pushed away with such disdain, had been making reflections upon the\\r\\nnature of true generosity.  A smile from her father, who stood by, a\\r\\nsilent spectator of the catastrophe of the filigree basket, gave rise to\\r\\nthese reflections; nor were they entirely dissipated by the condolence of\\r\\nthe rest of the company, nor even by the praises of her godmother, who,\\r\\nfor the purpose of condoling with her, said, \"Well, my dear Rosamond, I\\r\\nadmire your generous spirit.  You know I prophesied that your half-guinea\\r\\nwould be gone the soonest.  Did I not, Laura?\" said she, appealing, in a\\r\\nsarcastic tone, to where she thought Laura was.  \"Where is Laura?  I\\r\\ndon\\'t see her.\"  Laura came forward.  \"You are too PRUDENT to throw away\\r\\nyour money like your sister.  Your half-guinea, I\\'ll answer for it, is\\r\\nsnug in your pocket--Is it not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, madam,\" answered she, in a low voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut low as the voice of Laura was, the poor little lace-girl heard it;\\r\\nand now, for the first time, fixing her eyes upon Laura, recollected her\\r\\nbenefactress.  \"Oh, that\\'s the young lady!\" she exclaimed, in a tone of\\r\\njoyful gratitude, \"the good, good young lady, who gave me the half-\\r\\nguinea, and would not stay to be thanked for it; but I WILL thank her\\r\\nnow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The half-guinea, Laura!\" said her godmother.  \"What is all this?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll tell you, madam, if you please,\" said the little girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not in expectation of being praised for it, that Laura had been\\r\\ngenerous, and therefore everybody was really touched with the history of\\r\\nthe weaving-pillow; and whilst they praised, felt a certain degree of\\r\\nrespect, which is not always felt by those who pour forth eulogiums.\\r\\nRESPECT is not an improper word, even applied to a child of Laura\\'s age;\\r\\nfor let the age or situation of the person be what it may, they command\\r\\nrespect who deserve it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, madam!\" said Rosamond to her godmother, \"now you see--you see she is\\r\\nNOT a little miser.  I\\'m sure that\\'s better than wasting half a guinea\\r\\nupon a filigree basket; is it not, ma\\'am?\" said she, with an eagerness\\r\\nwhich showed that she had forgotten all her own misfortunes in sympathy\\r\\nwith her sister.  \"This is being REALLY GENEROUS, father, is it not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Rosamond,\" said her father, and he kissed her; \"this IS being\\r\\nreally generous.  It is not only by giving away money that we can show\\r\\ngenerosity; it is by giving up to others anything that we like ourselves:\\r\\nand therefore,\" added he, smiling, \"it is really generous of you to give\\r\\nyour sister the thing you like best of all others.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The thing I like the best of all others, father,\" said Rosamond, half\\r\\npleased, half vexed.  \"What is that, I wonder?  You don\\'t mean PRAISE, do\\r\\nyou, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, you must decide that yourself, Rosamond.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, sir,\" said she, ingenuously, \"perhaps it WAS ONCE the thing I liked\\r\\nbest; but the pleasure I have just felt makes me like something else much\\r\\nbetter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nETON MONTEM.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Extracted from the \"Courier\" of May, 1799.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yesterday this triennial ceremony took place, with which the public are\\r\\ntoo well acquainted to require a particular description.  A collection,\\r\\ncalled Salt, is taken from the public, which forms a purse, to support\\r\\nthe Captain of the School in his studies at Cambridge.  This collection\\r\\nis made by the Scholars, dressed in fancy dresses, all round the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At eleven o\\'clock, the youths being assembled in their habiliments at\\r\\nthe College, the Royal Family set off from the Castle to see them, and,\\r\\nafter walking round the Courtyard, they proceeded to Salt Hill in the\\r\\nfollowing order:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His Majesty, his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, and the Earl of\\r\\nUxbridge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Their Royal Highnesses the Dukes of Kent and Cumberland, Earl Morton,\\r\\nand General Gwynne, all on horseback, dressed in the Windsor uniform,\\r\\nexcept the Prince of Wales, who wore a suit of dark blue, and a brown\\r\\nsurtout over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then followed the Scholars, preceded by the Marechal Serjeant, the\\r\\nMusicians of the Staffordshire Band, and Mr. Ford, Captain of the\\r\\nSeminary, the Serjeant Major, Serjeants, Colonels, Corporals, Musicians,\\r\\nEnsign, Lieutenant, Steward, Salt Bearers, Polemen, and Runners.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The cavalcade was brought up by her Majesty and her amiable daughters in\\r\\ntwo carriages, and a numerous company of equestrians and pedestrians, all\\r\\neager to behold their Sovereign and his family.  Among the former, Lady\\r\\nLade was foremost in the throng; only two others dared venture their\\r\\npersons on horseback in such a multitude.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The King and Royal Family were stopped on Eton Bridge by Messrs. Young\\r\\nand Mansfield, the Salt Bearers, to whom their Majesties delivered their\\r\\ncustomary donation of fifty guineas each.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Salt Hill, his Majesty, with his usual affability, took upon himself\\r\\nto arrange the procession round the Royal carriages; and even when the\\r\\nhorses were taken off, with the assistance of the Duke of Kent, fastened\\r\\nthe traces round the pole of the coaches, to prevent any inconvenience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An exceeding heavy shower of rain coming on, the Prince took leave, and\\r\\nwent to the \\'Windmill Inn,\\' till it subsided.  The King and his\\r\\nattendants weathered it out in their great-coats.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After the young gentlemen walked round the carriage, Ensign Vince and\\r\\nthe Salt Bearers proceeded to the summit of the hill; but the wind being\\r\\nboisterous, he could not exhibit his dexterity in displaying his flag,\\r\\nand the space being too small before the carriages, from the concourse of\\r\\nspectators, the King kindly acquiesced in not having it displayed under\\r\\nsuch inconvenience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Their Majesties and the Princesses then returned home, the King\\r\\noccasionally stopping to converse with the Dean of Windsor, the Earl of\\r\\nHarrington, and other noblemen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Scholars partook of an elegant dinner at the \\'Windmill Inn,\\' and in\\r\\nthe evening walked on Windsor Terrace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cumberland, after\\r\\ntaking leave of their Majesties, set off for town, and honoured the Opera\\r\\nHouse with their presence in the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The profit arising from the Salt collected, according to account,\\r\\namounted to 8OO pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Stadtholder, the Duke of Gordon, Lord and Lady Melbourne, Viscount\\r\\nBrome, and a numerous train of fashionable nobility, were present.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The following is an account of their dresses, made as usual, very\\r\\nhandsomely, by Mrs. Snow, milliner, of Windsor:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Ford, Captain, with eight Gentlemen to attend him as servitors.\\r\\n\"Mr. Sarjeant, Marechal.\\r\\n\"Mr. Bradith, Colonel.\\r\\n\"Mr. Plumtree, Lieutenant.\\r\\n\"Mr. Vince, Ensign.\\r\\n\"Mr. Young, College Salt Bearer; white and gold dress, rich satin bag,\\r\\ncovered with gold netting.\\r\\n\"Mr. Mansfield, Oppidan, white, purple, and orange dress, trimmed with\\r\\nsilver; rich satin bag, purple and silver:  each carrying elegant poles,\\r\\nwith gold and silver cord.\\r\\n\"Mr. Keity, yellow and black velvet; helmet trimmed with silver.\\r\\n\"Mr. Bartelot, plain mantle and sandals, Scotch bonnet, a very Douglas.\\r\\n\"Mr. Knapp, flesh-colour and blue; Spanish hat and feathers.\\r\\n\"Mr. Ripley, rose-colour; helmet.\\r\\n\"Mr. Islip (being in mourning), a scarf; helmet, black velvet; and white\\r\\nsatin.\\r\\n\"Mr. Tomkins, violet and silver; helmet.\\r\\n\"Mr. Thackery, lilac and silver; Roman Cap.\\r\\n\"Mr. Drury, mazarin blue; fancy cap.\\r\\n\"Mr. Davis, slate-colour and straw.\\r\\n\"Mr. Routh, pink and silver, Spanish hat.\\r\\n\"Mr. Curtis, purple, fancy cap.\\r\\n\"Mr. Lloyd, blue; ditto.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the conclusion of the ceremony the Royal Family returned to Windsor,\\r\\nand the boys were all sumptuously entertained at the tavern at Salt Hill.\\r\\nAbout six in the evening all the boys returned in the order of\\r\\nprocession, and, marching round the great square of Eton, were dismissed.\\r\\nThe captain then paid his respects to the Royal Family, at the Queen\\'s\\r\\nLodge, Windsor, previously to his departure for King\\'s College,\\r\\nCambridge, to defray which expense the produce of the Montem was\\r\\npresented to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The day concluded by a brilliant promenade of beauty, rank, and fashion,\\r\\non Windsor Terrace, enlivened by the performance of several bands of\\r\\nmusic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The origin of the procession is from the custom by which the Manor was\\r\\nheld.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The custom of hunting the Ram belonged to Eton College, as well as the\\r\\ncustom of Salt; but it was discontinued by Dr. Cook, late Dean of Ely.\\r\\nNow this custom we know to have been entered on the register of the Royal\\r\\nAbbey of Bec, in Normandy, as one belonging to the Manor of East or Great\\r\\nWrotham, in Norfolk, given by Ralph de Toni to the Abbey of Bec, and was\\r\\nas follows:--When the harvest was finished the tenants were to have half\\r\\nan acre of barley, and a ram let loose; and if they caught him he was\\r\\ntheir own to make merry with; but if he escaped from them he was the\\r\\nLord\\'s.  The Etonians, in order to secure the ram, houghed him in the\\r\\nIrish fashion, and then attacked him with great clubs.  The cruelty of\\r\\nthis proceeding brought it into disuse, and now it exists no longer.--See\\r\\nRegister of the Royal Abbey of Bec, folio 58.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After the dissolution of the alien priories, in 1414, by the Parliament\\r\\nof Leicester, they remained in the Crown till Henry VI., who gave Wrotham\\r\\nManor to Eton College; and if the Eton Fellows would search, they would\\r\\nperhaps find the Manor in their possession, that was held by the custom\\r\\nof Salt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlderman Bursal, Father of young Bursal.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord John,      )\\r\\nTalbot,         )\\r\\nWheeler,        ) Young Gentlemen of Eton, from 17 to 19 years of age.\\r\\nBursal,         )\\r\\nRory O\\'Ryan     )\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Newington, Landlord of the Inn at Salt Hill.\\r\\nFarmer Hearty.\\r\\nA Waiter and crowd of Eton Lads.\\r\\n\\r\\nWOMEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Marchioness of Piercefield, Mother of Lord John.\\r\\nLady Violetta--her Daughter, a Child of six or seven years old.\\r\\nMrs. Talbot.\\r\\nLousia Talbot, her Daughter.\\r\\nMiss Bursal, Daughter to the Alderman.\\r\\nMrs. Newington, Landlady of the Inn at Salt Hill.\\r\\nSally, a Chambermaid.\\r\\nPatty, a Country Girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n                 Pipe and Tabor, and Dance of Peasants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE I.\\r\\n\\r\\n          The Bar of the \"Windmill Inn\" at Salt Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\n          MR. and MRS. NEWINGTON, the Landlord and Landlady.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  \\'Tis an unpossibility, Mr. Newington; and that\\'s enough.  Say\\r\\nno more about it; \\'tis an unpossibility in the natur of things.  (She\\r\\nranges jellies, etc., in the Bar.)  And pray, do you take your great old\\r\\nfashioned tankard, Mr. Newington, from among my jellies and\\r\\nconfectioneries.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord (takes his tankard and drinks).  Anything for a quiet life.  If\\r\\nit is an impossibility, I\\'ve no more to say; only, for the soul of me, I\\r\\ncan\\'t see the great unpossibility, wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Wife, indeed!--wife!--wife! wife every minute.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Heyday!  Why, what a plague would you have me call you?  The\\r\\nother day you quarrelled with me for calling you Mrs. Landlady.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  To be sure I did, and very proper in me I should.  I\\'ve turned\\r\\noff three waiters and five chambermaids already, for screaming after me\\r\\nMrs. Landlady! Mrs. Landlady!  But \\'tis all your ill manners.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Ill manners!  Why, if I may be so bold, if you are not Mrs.\\r\\nLandlady, in the name of wonder what are you?\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Mrs. Newington, Mr. Newington.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord (drinks).  Mrs. Newington, Mr. Newington drinks your health; for\\r\\nI suppose I must not be landlord any more in my own house (shrugs).\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Oh, as to that, I have no objections nor impediments to your\\r\\nbeing called LANDLORD.  You look it, and become it very proper.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Why, yes, indeed, thank my tankard, I do look it, and become\\r\\nit, and am nowise ashamed of it; but everyone to their mind, as you,\\r\\nwife, don\\'t fancy the being called Mrs. Landlady.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  To be sure I don\\'t.  Why, when folks hear the old fashioned\\r\\ncry of Mrs. Landlady! Mrs. Landlady! who do they expect, think you, to\\r\\nsee, but an overgrown, fat, featherbed of a woman, coming waddling along\\r\\nwith her thumbs sticking on each side of her apron, o\\' this fashion?\\r\\nNow, to see me coming, nobody would take me to be a landlady.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Very true, indeed, wife--Mrs. Newington, I mean--I ask pardon;\\r\\nbut now to go on with what we were saying about the unpossibility of\\r\\nletting that old lady, and the civil-spoken young lady there above, have\\r\\nthem there rooms for another day.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Now, Mr. Newington, let me hear no more about that old\\r\\ngentlewoman, and that civil-spoken young lady.  Fair words cost nothing;\\r\\nand I\\'ve a notion that\\'s the cause they are so plenty with the young\\r\\nlady.  Neither o\\' them, I take it, by what they\\'ve ordered since their\\r\\ncoming into the house, are such grand folk, that one need be so\\r\\npetticular about them.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Why, they came only in a chaise and pair, to be sure; I can\\'t\\r\\ndeny that.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  But, bless my stars! what signifies talking?  Don\\'t you know,\\r\\nas well as I do, Mr. Newington, that to-morrow is Eton Montem, and that\\r\\nif we had twenty times as many rooms and as many more to the back of\\r\\nthem, it would not be one too many for all the company we\\'ve a right to\\r\\nexpect, and those the highest quality of the land?  Nay, what do I talk\\r\\nof to-morrow? isn\\'t my Lady Piercefield and suite expected? and,\\r\\nmoreover, Mr. and Miss Bursal\\'s to be here, and will call for as much in\\r\\nan hour as your civil-spoken young lady in a twelvemonth, I reckon.  So,\\r\\nMr. Newington, if you don\\'t think proper to go up and inform the ladies\\r\\nabove, that the Dolphin rooms are not for them, I must SPEAK myself,\\r\\nthough \\'tis a thing I never do when I can help it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord (aside).  She not like to speak!  (Aloud.)  My dear, you can\\r\\nspeak a power better than I can; so take it all upon yourself, if you\\r\\nplease; for, old-fashioned as I and my tankard here be, I can\\'t make a\\r\\nspeech that borders on the uncivil order, to a lady like, for the life\\r\\nand lungs of me.  So, in the name of goodness, do you go up, Mrs.\\r\\nNewington.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  And so I will, Mr. Newington.  Help ye!  Civilities and\\r\\nrarities are out o\\' season for them that can\\'t pay for them in this\\r\\nworld; and very proper.  [Exit Landlady.]\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  And very proper!  Ha! who comes yonder?  The Eton chap who\\r\\nwheedled me into lending him my best hunter last year, and was the\\r\\nruination of him; but that must be paid for, wheedle or no wheedle; and,\\r\\nfor the matter of wheedling, I\\'d stake this here Mr. Wheeler, that is\\r\\nmaking up to me, do you see, against e\\'er a boy, or hobbledehoy, in all\\r\\nEton, London, or Christendom, let the other be who he will.\\r\\n\\r\\n                  Enter WHEELER.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheeler.  A fine day, Mr. Newington.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  A fine day, Mr. Wheeler.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  And I hope, for YOUR sake, we may have as fine a day for the\\r\\nMontem to-morrow.  It will be a pretty penny in your pocket!  Why, all\\r\\nthe world will be here; and (looking round at the jellies, etc.) so much\\r\\nthe better for them; for here are good things enough, and enough for\\r\\nthem.  And here\\'s the best thing of all, the good old tankard still; not\\r\\nempty, I hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Not empty, I hope.  Here\\'s to you, Mr. Wheeler.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Mr. Wheeler!--CAPTAIN Wheeler, if you please.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  YOU, Captain Wheeler!  Why, I thought in former times it was\\r\\nalways the oldest scholar at Eton that was Captain at the Montems; and\\r\\ndidn\\'t Mr. Talbot come afore you?\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Not at all; we came on the same day.  Some say I came first; some\\r\\nsay Talbot.  So the choice of which of us is to be captain is to be put\\r\\nto the vote amongst the lads--most votes carry it; and I have most votes,\\r\\nI fancy; so I shall be captain, to-morrow, and a pretty deal of salt* I\\r\\nreckon I shall pocket.  Why, the collection at the last Montem, they say,\\r\\ncame to a plump thousand!  No bad thing for a young fellow to set out\\r\\nwith for Oxford or Cambridge--hey?\\r\\n\\r\\n*Salt, the cant name given by the Eton lads to the money collected at\\r\\nMontem.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  And no bad thing, before he sets out for Cambridge or Oxford,\\r\\n\\'twould be for a young gentleman to pay his debts.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Debts!  Oh, time enough for that.  I\\'ve a little account with you\\r\\nin horses, I know; but that\\'s between you and me, you know--mum.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Mum me no mums, Mr. Wheeler.  Between you and me, my best\\r\\nhunter has been ruinationed; and I can\\'t afford to be mum.  So you\\'ll\\r\\ntake no offence if I speak; and as you\\'ll set off to-morrow, as soon as\\r\\nthe Montem\\'s over, you\\'ll be pleased to settle with me some way or other\\r\\nto-day, as we\\'ve no other time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  No time so proper, certainly.  Where\\'s the little account?--I\\r\\nhave money sent me for my Montem dress, and I can squeeze that much out\\r\\nof it.  I came home from Eton on purpose to settle with you.  But as to\\r\\nthe hunter, you must call upon Talbot--do you understand? to pay for him;\\r\\nfor though Talbot and I had him the same day, \\'twas Talbot did for him,\\r\\nand Talbot must pay.  I spoke to him about it, and charged him to\\r\\nremember you; for I never forget to speak a good word for my friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  So I perceive.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  I\\'ll make bold just to give you my opinion of these jellies\\r\\nwhilst you are getting my account, Mr. Newington.\\r\\n\\r\\n         (He swallows down a jelly or two--Landlord is going.)\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter TALBOT.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalbot.  Hallo, Landlord! where are making off so fast?  Here, your\\r\\njellies are all going as fast as yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. (aside).  Talbot!--I wish I was a hundred miles off.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  You are heartily welcome, Mr. Talbot.  A good morning to you,\\r\\nsir; I\\'m glad to see you--very glad to see you, Mr. Talbot.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Then shake hands, my honest landlord.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Talbot, in shaking hands with him, puts a purse into the landlord\\'s\\r\\nhands.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  What\\'s here?  Guineas?\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  The hunter, you know; since Wheeler won\\'t pay, I must--that\\'s all.\\r\\nGood morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  (aside).  What a fool!\\r\\n\\r\\n          (Landlord, as Talbot is going, catches hold of his coat.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Hold, Mr. Talbot, this won\\'t do!\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Won\\'t it?  Well, then, my watch must go.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Nay, nay! but you are in such a hurry to pay--you won\\'t hear a\\r\\nman.  Half this is enough for your share o\\' the mischief, in all\\r\\nconscience.  Mr. Wheeler, there, had the horse on the same day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  But Bursal\\'s my witness--\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Oh, say no more about witnesses; a man\\'s conscience is always his\\r\\nbest witness, or his worst.  Landlord, take your money, and no more\\r\\nwords.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  This is very genteel of you, Talbot.  I always thought you would\\r\\ndo the genteel thing as I knew you to be so generous and considerate.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Don\\'t waste your fine speeches, Wheeler, I advise you, this\\r\\nelection time.  Keep them for Bursal or Lord John, or some of those who\\r\\nlike them.  They won\\'t go down with me.  Good morning to you.  I give you\\r\\nnotice, I\\'m going back to Eton as fast as I can gallop; and who knows\\r\\nwhat plain speaking may do with the Eton lads?  I may be captain yet,\\r\\nWheeler.  Have a care!  Is my horse ready there?\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Mr. Talbot\\'s horse, there!  Mr. Talbot\\'s horse, I say.\\r\\n\\r\\n                           Talbot sings.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"He carries weight--he rides a race--\\r\\n      \\'Tis for a thousand pound!\"                 (Exit Talbot.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  And, dear me! I shall be left behind.  A horse for me, pray; a\\r\\nhorse for Mr. Wheeler!                            (Exit Wheeler.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord (calls very loud).  Mr. Talbot\\'s horse!  Hang the hostler!  I\\'ll\\r\\nsaddle him myself.                           (Exit Landlord.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II.\\r\\n\\r\\n                A Dining room in the Inn at Salt Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\n                     MRS. TALBOT and LOUISA.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa (laughing).  With what an air Mrs. Landlady made her exit!\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talbot.  When I was young, they say, I was proud; but I am humble\\r\\nenough now:  these petty mortifications do not vex me.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  It is well my brother was gone before Mrs. Landlady made her\\r\\nentree; for if he had heard her rude speech, he would at least have given\\r\\nher the retort courteous.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  Now tell me honestly, my Louisa--You were, a few days ago, at\\r\\nBursal House.  Since you have left it and have felt something of the\\r\\ndifference that is made in this world between splendour and no splendour,\\r\\nyou have never regretted that you did not stay there, and that you did\\r\\nnot bear more patiently with Miss Bursal\\'s little airs?\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  Never for a moment.  At first Miss Bursal paid me a vast deal of\\r\\nattention; but, for what reason I know not, she suddenly changed her\\r\\nmanner, grew first strangely cold, then condescendingly familiar, and at\\r\\nlast downright rude.  I could not guess the cause of these variations.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb. (aside) I guess the cause too well.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  But as I perceived the lady was out of tune, I was in haste to\\r\\nleave her.  I should make a very bad, and, I am sure, a miserable toad\\r\\neater.  I had much rather, if I were obliged to choose, earn my own\\r\\nbread, than live as toad eater with anybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  Fine talking, dear Louisa!\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  Don\\'t you believe me to be in earnest, mother!  To be sure, you\\r\\ncannot know what I would do, unless I were put to the trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  Nor you either, my dear.    (She sighs, and is silent.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa (takes her mother\\'s hand).  What is the matter, dear mother?  You\\r\\nused to say, that seeing my brother always made you feel ten years\\r\\nyounger; yet even while he was here, you had, in spite of all your\\r\\nefforts to conceal them, those sudden fits of sadness.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  The Montem--is not it to-morrow?  Ay, but my boy is not sure\\r\\nof being captain.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  No; there is one Wheeler, who, as he says, is most likely to be\\r\\nchosen captain.  He has taken prodigious pains to flatter and win over\\r\\nmany to his interest.  My brother does not so much care about it; he is\\r\\nnot avaricious.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  I love your generous spirit and his! but, alas! my dear,\\r\\npeople may live to want, and wish for money, without being avaricious.  I\\r\\nwould not say a word to Talbot; full of spirits as he was this morning, I\\r\\nwould not say a word to him, till after the Montem, of what has happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  And what has happened, dear mother?  Sit down,--you tremble.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb. (sits down and puts a letter into Louisa\\'s hand.) Read that,\\r\\nlove.  A messenger brought me that from town a few hours ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa (reads).  \"By an express from Portsmouth, we hear the Bombay\\r\\nCastle East Indiaman is lost, with all your fortune on board.\"  ALL!  I\\r\\nhope there is something left for you to live upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  About 15O pounds a year for us all.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  That is enough, is it not, for YOU?\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  For me, love?  I am an old woman, and want but little in this\\r\\nworld, and shall be soon out of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa (kneels down beside her).  Do not speak so, dearest mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  Enough for me, love!  Yes, enough, and too much for me.  I am\\r\\nnot thinking of myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  Then, as to my brother, he has such abilities, and such\\r\\nindustry, he will make a fortune at the bar for himself, most certainly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  But his education is not completed.  How shall we provide him\\r\\nwith money at Cambridge?\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  This Montem.  The last time the captain had eight hundred, the\\r\\ntime before a thousand, pounds.  Oh, I hope--I fear!  Now, indeed, I know\\r\\nthat, without being avaricious, we may want, and wish for money.\\r\\n\\r\\n                 (Landlady\\'s voice heard behind the scenes.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Waiter!--Miss Bursal\\'s curricle, and Mr. Bursal\\'s vis-a-vis.\\r\\nRun! see that the Dolphin\\'s empty.  I say run!--run!\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  I will rest for a few moments upon the sofa, in this\\r\\nbedchamber, before we set off.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa (goes to open the door).  They have bolted or locked it.  How\\r\\nunlucky!           (She turns the key, and tries to unlock the door.)\\r\\n\\r\\n                           Enter WAITER.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaiter.  Ladies, I\\'m sorry--Miss Bursal and Mr. Bursal are come--just\\r\\ncoming upstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  Then, will you be so good, sir, as to unlock this door?\\r\\n                                (Waiter tries to unlock the door.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWaiter.  It must be bolted on the inside.  Chambermaid!  Sally!  Are you\\r\\nwithin there?  Unbolt this door.\\r\\n\\r\\n                           Mr. Bursal\\'s voice behind the scenes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Burs.  Let me have a basin of good soup directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaiter.  I\\'ll go round and have the door unbolted immediately, ladies.\\r\\n                                           (Exit Waiter.)\\r\\n\\r\\n        Enter MISS BURSAL, in a riding dress, and with a long whip.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bursal.  Those creatures, the ponies, have a\\'most pulled my \\'and\\r\\noff.  Who \\'ave we \\'ere?  Ha!  Mrs. Talbot!  Louisa, \\'ow are ye?  I\\'m so\\r\\nvastly glad to see you; but I\\'m so shocked to \\'ear of the loss of the\\r\\nBombay Castle.  Mrs. Talbot, you look but poorly; but this Montem will\\r\\nput everybody in spirits.  I \\'ear everybody\\'s to be \\'ere; and my brother\\r\\ntells me, \\'twill be the finest ever seen at HEton.  Louisa, my dear, I\\'m\\r\\nsorry I\\'ve not a seat for you in my curricle for to-morrow; but I\\'ve\\r\\npromised Lady Betty; so, you know, \\'tis impossible for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  Certainly; and it would be impossible for me to leave my mother\\r\\nat present.\\r\\n\\r\\nChambermaid (opens the bedchamber door).  The room\\'s ready now, ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  Miss Bursal, we intrude upon you no longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Burs.  Nay, why do you decamp, Mrs. Talbot?  I \\'ad a thousand things\\r\\nto say to you, Louisa; but am so tired and so annoyed--\\r\\n\\r\\n         (Seats herself. Exeunt Mrs. Talbot, Louisa and Chambermaid.)\\r\\n\\r\\n          Enter MR. BURSAL, with a basin of soup in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Burs.  Well, thank my stars the Airly Castle is safe in the Downs.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Burs.  Mr. Bursal, can you inform me why Joe, my groom, does not\\r\\nmake his appearance?\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Burs. (eating and speaking).  Yes, that I can, child; because he is\\r\\nwith his \\'orses, where he ought to be.  \\'Tis fit they should be looked\\r\\nafter well; for they cost me a pretty penny--more than their heads are\\r\\nworth, and yours into the bargain; but I was resolved, as we were to come\\r\\nto this Montem, to come in style.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Burs.  In style, to be sure; for all the world\\'s to be here--the\\r\\nKing, the Prince of WHales, and Duke o\\' York, and all the first people;\\r\\nand we shall cut a dash!  Dash! dash! will be the word to-morrow!--\\r\\n(playing with her whip).\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Burs. (aside).  Dash! dash! ay, just like her brother.  He\\'ll pay\\r\\naway finely, I warrant, by the time he\\'s her age.  Well, well, he can\\r\\nafford it; and I do love to see my children make a figure for their\\r\\nmoney.  As Jack Bursal says, what\\'s money for, if it e\\'nt to make a\\r\\nfigure.  (Aloud).  There\\'s your, brother Jack, now.  The extravagant dog!\\r\\nhe\\'ll have such a dress as never was seen, I suppose, at this here\\r\\nMontem.  Why, now, Jack Bursal spends more money at Eton, and has more to\\r\\nspend, than my Lord John, though my Lord John\\'s the son of a marchioness.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Burs.  Oh, that makes no difference nowadays.  I wonder whether her\\r\\nladyship is to be at this Montem.  The only good I ever got out of these\\r\\nstupid Talbots was an introduction to their friend Lady Piercefield.\\r\\nWhat she could find to like in the Talbots, heaven knows.  I\\'ve a notion\\r\\nshe\\'ll drop them, when she hears of the loss of the Bombay Castle.\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter a WAITER, with a note.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaiter.  A note from my Lady Piercefield, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss B.  Charming woman!  Is she here, pray, sir?\\r\\n\\r\\nWaiter.  Just come.  Yes, ma\\'am.           (Exit Waiter.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss B.  Well, Mr. Bursal, what is it?\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. B. (reads).  \"Business of importance to communicate--\"  Hum! what can\\r\\nit be?--(going).\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss B. (aside).  Perhaps some match to propose for me!  (Aloud).  Mr.\\r\\nBursal, pray before you go to her ladyship, do send my OOMAN to me to\\r\\nmake me presentable.                (Exit Miss Bursal at one door.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. B. (at the opposite door).  \"Business of importance!\"   Hum! I\\'m glad\\r\\nI\\'m prepared with a good basin of soup.  There\\'s no doing business well\\r\\nupon an empty stomach.  Perhaps the business is to lend cash; and I\\'ve no\\r\\ngreat stomach for that.  But it will be an honour, to be sure.\\r\\n                                                    (Exit.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III.\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Landlady\\'s Parlour.\\r\\n\\r\\nLANDLADY--MR. FINSBURY, a man-milliner, with bandboxes--a fancy cap, or\\r\\nhelmet, with feathers, in the Landlady\\'s hand--a satin bag, covered with\\r\\ngold netting, in the man-milliner\\'s hand--a mantle hanging over his arm.\\r\\nA rough looking Farmer is sitting with his back towards them, eating\\r\\nbread and cheese, and reading a newspaper.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Well, this, to be sure, will be the best dressed Montem that\\r\\never was seen at Eton; and you Lon\\'on gentlemen have the most\\r\\nfashionablest notions; and this is the most elegantest fancy cap--\\r\\n\\r\\nFinsbury.  Why, as you observe, ma\\'m, that is the most elegant fancy cap\\r\\nof them all.  That is Mr. Hector Hogmorton\\'s fancy cap, ma\\'m; and here,\\r\\nma\\'m, is Mr. Saul\\'s rich satin bag, covered with gold net.  He is college\\r\\nsalt bearer, I understand, and has a prodigious superb white and gold\\r\\ndress.  But, in my humble opinion, ma\\'m, the marshal\\'s white and purple\\r\\nand orange fancy dress, trimmed with silver, will bear the bell; though,\\r\\nindeed, I shouldn\\'t say that,--for the colonel\\'s and lieutenant\\'s, and\\r\\nensign\\'s, are beautiful in the extreme.  And, to be sure, nothing could\\r\\nbe better imagined than Mr. Marlborough\\'s lilac and silver, with a Roman\\r\\ncap.  And it must be allowed that nothing in nature can have a better\\r\\neffect than Mr. Drake\\'s flesh-colour and blue, with this Spanish hat,\\r\\nma\\'m, you see.\\r\\n\\r\\n(The farmer looks over his shoulder from time to time during this speech,\\r\\nwith contempt.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFarmer (reads the newspaper).  French fleet at sea--Hum!\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  O gemini:  Mr. Drake\\'s Spanish hat is the sweetest, tastiest\\r\\nthing!  Mr. Finsbury, I protest--\\r\\n\\r\\nFinsb.  Why, ma\\'m, I knew a lady of your taste couldn\\'t but approve of\\r\\nit.  My own invention entirely, ma\\'m.  But it\\'s nothing to the captain\\'s\\r\\ncap, ma\\'m.  Indeed, ma\\'m, Mr. Wheeler, the captain that is to be, has the\\r\\nprettiest taste in dress.  To be sure, his sandals were my suggestion;\\r\\nbut the mantle he has the entire credit of, to do him justice; and when\\r\\nyou see it, ma\\'m, you will be really surprised; for (for contrast, and\\r\\nelegance, and richness, and lightness, and propriety, and effect, and\\r\\ncostume) you\\'ve never yet seen anything at all to be compared to Captain\\r\\nWheeler\\'s mantle, ma\\'m.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarmer (to the Landlady).  Why, now, pray, Mrs. Landlady, how long may it\\r\\nhave been the fashion for milliners to go about in men\\'s clothes?\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady (aside to Farmer).  Lord, Mr. Hearty, hush!  This is Mr.\\r\\nFinsbury, the great man-milliner.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  The great man-milliner!  This is a sight I never thought to see in\\r\\nOld England.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinsb.  (packing up band boxes).  Well, ma\\'m, I\\'m glad I have your\\r\\napprobation.  It has ever been my study to please the ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  (throws a fancy mantle over his frieze coat).  And is this the way\\r\\nto please the ladies, Mrs. Landlady, nowadays?\\r\\n\\r\\nFinsb.  (taking off the mantle).  Sir, with your leave--I ask pardon--but\\r\\nthe least thing detriments these tender colours; and as you have just\\r\\nbeen eating cheese with your hands--\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  \\'Tis my way to eat cheese with my mouth, man.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinsb.  MAN!\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  I ask pardon--man-milliner, I mean.\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Enter LANDLORD.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Why, wife!\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Wife!\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  I ask pardon--Mrs. Newington, I mean.  Do you know who them\\r\\nladies are that you have been and turned out of the Dolphin?\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady (alarmed).  Not I, indeed.  Who are they, pray?  Why, if they\\r\\nare quality it\\'s no fault of mine.  It is their own fault for coming,\\r\\nlike scrubs, without four horses.  Why, if quality will travel the road\\r\\nthis way, incognito, how can they expect to be known and treated as\\r\\nquality?  \\'Tis no fault of mine.  Why didn\\'t you find out sooner who they\\r\\nwere, Mr. Newington?  What else, in the \\'versal world have you to do, but\\r\\nto go basking about in the yards and places with your tankard in your\\r\\nhand, from morning till night?  What have you else to ruminate, all day\\r\\nlong, but to find out who\\'s who, I say?\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  Clapper! clapper! clapper! like my mill in a high wind, landlord.\\r\\nClapper! clapper! clapper!--enough to stun a body.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  That is not used to it; but use is all, they say.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Will you answer me, Mr. Newington?  Who are the grandees that\\r\\nwere in the Dolphin?--and what\\'s become on them?\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Grandees was your own word, wife.  They be not to call\\r\\ngrandees; but I reckon you\\'d be sorry not to treat \\'em civil, when I tell\\r\\nyou their name is Talbot, mother and sister to our young Talbot, of Eton;\\r\\nhe that paid me so handsome for the hunter this very morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Mercy! is that all?  What a combustion for nothing in life!\\r\\n\\r\\nFinsb.  For nothing in life, as you say, ma\\'m; that is, nothing in high\\r\\nlife, I\\'m sure, ma\\'m; nay, I dare a\\'most venture to swear.  Would you\\r\\nbelieve it, Mr. Talbot is one of the few young gentlemen of Eton that has\\r\\nnot bespoke from me a fancy dress for this grand Montem?\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  There, Mr. Newington; there\\'s your Talbot for you! and there\\'s\\r\\nyour grandees!  O trust me, I know your scrubs at first sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Scrubs, I don\\'t, nor can\\'t, nor won\\'t call them that pay their\\r\\ndebts honestly.  Scrubs, I don\\'t, nor won\\'t, nor can\\'t, call them that\\r\\nbehave as handsome as young Mr. Talbot did here to me this morning about\\r\\nthe hunter.  A scrub he is not, wife.  Fancy-dress or no fancy-dress, Mr.\\r\\nFinsbury, this young gentleman is no scrub.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinsb.  Dear me!  \\'Twas not I said SCRUB.  Did I say scrub?\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  No matter if you did.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinsb.  No matter, certainly; and yet it is a matter; for I\\'m confident I\\r\\nwouldn\\'t for the world leave it in anyone\\'s power to say that I said--\\r\\nthat I called--any young gentleman of Eton a SCRUB!  Why, you know, sir,\\r\\nit might breed a riot!\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  And a pretty figure you\\'d make in a riot!\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Pray let me hear nothing about riots in my house.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  Nor about scrubs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinsb.  But I beg leave to explain, gentlemen.  All I ventured to remark\\r\\nor suggest was, that as there was some talk of Mr. Talbot\\'s being captain\\r\\nto-morrow, I didn\\'t conceive how he could well appear without any dress.\\r\\nThat was all, upon my word and honour.  A good morning to you, gentlemen;\\r\\nit is time for me to be off.  Mrs. Newington, you were so obliging as to\\r\\npromise to accommodate me with a return chaise as far as Eton.\\r\\n(Finsbury bows and exit.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  A good day to you and your bandboxes.  There\\'s a fellow for you\\r\\nnow!  Ha! ha! ha!--A man-milliner, forsooth!\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  Mrs. Talbot\\'s coming--stand back.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  Lord! why does Bob show them through this way?\\r\\n\\r\\n    Enter MRS. TALBOT, leaning on LOUISA; Waiter showing the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  You are going on, I suppose, ma\\'am?\\r\\n\\r\\nWaiter (aside to Landlord).  Not if she could help it; but there\\'s no\\r\\nbeds, since Mr. Bursal and Miss Bursal\\'s come.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  I say nothing, for it is vain to say more.  But isn\\'t it a\\r\\npity she can\\'t stay for the Montem, poor old lady!  Her son--as good and\\r\\nfine a lad as ever you saw--they say, has a chance, too, of being\\r\\ncaptain.  She may never live to see another such a sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n     (As Mrs. Talbot walks slowly on, the Farmer puts himself across her\\r\\nway, so as to stop her short.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  No offence, madam, I hope; but I have a good snug farm house, not\\r\\nfar off hand; and if so be you\\'d be so good to take a night\\'s lodging,\\r\\nyou and the young lady with you, you\\'d have a hearty welcome.  That\\'s all\\r\\nI can say and you\\'d make my wife very happy; for she\\'s a good woman, to\\r\\nsay nothing of myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord.  If I may be so bold to put in my word, madam, you\\'d have as\\r\\ngood beds, and be as well lodged, with Farmer Hearty, as in e\\'er a house\\r\\nat Salt Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Talb.  I am very much obliged--\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  O, say nothing o\\' that, madam.  I am sure I shall be as much\\r\\nobliged if you do come.  Do, miss, speak for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  Pray, dear mother--\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  She will.  (Calls behind the scenes.)  Here, waiter! hostler!\\r\\ndriver! what\\'s your name? drive the chaise up here to the door, smart,\\r\\nclose.  Lean on my arm, madam, and we\\'ll have you in and home in a whiff.\\r\\n(Exeunt Mrs. Talbot, Louisa, Farmer, Landlord and Waiter.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady (sola).  What a noise and a rout this farmer man makes! and my\\r\\nhusband, with his great broad face, bowing, as great a nincompoop as\\r\\nt\\'other.  The folks are all bewitched with the old woman, I verily\\r\\nbelieve.  (Aloud.) A good morning to you, ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\n                          END OF THE FIRST ACT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                             ACT THE SECOND.\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE I.\\r\\n\\r\\nA field near Eton College;--several boys crossing backwards and forwards\\r\\nin the back-ground.  In front, TALBOT, WHEELER, LORD JOHN and BURSAL.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalbot.  Fair play, Wheeler!  Have at \\'em, my boy!  There they stand,\\r\\nfair game!  There\\'s Bursal there, with his dead forty-five votes at\\r\\ncommand; and Lord John with his--how many live friends?\\r\\n\\r\\nLord John (coolly).  Sir, I have fifty-six friends, I believe.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Fifty-six friends, his lordship believes--Wheeler inclusive, no\\r\\ndoubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  That\\'s as hereafter may be.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheeler.  Hereafter! Oh, fie, my LUD!  You know your own Wheeler has,\\r\\nfrom the first minute he ever saw you, been your fast friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Your fast friend from the first minute he ever saw you, my lord!\\r\\nThat\\'s well hit, Wheeler; stick to that; stick fast.  Fifty-six friends,\\r\\nWheeler INclusive, hey, my lord! hey, my LUD!\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Talbot EXclusive, I find, contrary to my expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Ay, contrary to your expectations, you find that Talbot is not a\\r\\ndog that will lick the dust:  but then there\\'s enough of the true spaniel\\r\\nbreed to be had for whistling for; hey, Wheeler?\\r\\n\\r\\nBursal (aside to Wheeler).  A pretty electioneerer.  So much the better\\r\\nfor you, Wheeler.  Why, unless he bought a vote, he\\'d never win one, if\\r\\nhe talked from this to the day of judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheeler (aside to Bursal).  And as he has no money to buy votes--he! he!\\r\\nhe!--we are safe enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  That\\'s well done, Wheeler; fight the by-battle there with Bursal.\\r\\nNow you are sure of the main with Lord John.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Sure! I never made Mr. Wheeler any promise yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  O; I ask no promise from his lordship; we are upon honour:  I\\r\\ntrust entirely to his lordship\\'s good nature and generosity, and to his\\r\\nregard for his own family; I having the honour, though distantly, to be\\r\\nrelated.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Related!  How, Wheeler?\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Connected, I mean, which is next door, as I may say, to being\\r\\nrelated.  Related slipped out by mistake; I beg pardon, my Lord John.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Related!--a strange mistake, Wheeler.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Overshot yourself, Wheeler; overshot yourself, by all that\\'s\\r\\nawkward.  And yet, till now, I always took you for \"a dead-shot at a\\r\\nyellow-hammer.\"*\\r\\n\\r\\n*Young noblemen at Oxford wear yellow tufts at the tops of their caps.\\r\\nHence their flatterers are said to be dead-shots at yellow-hammers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. (taking Bursal by the arm).  Bursal, a word with you.  (Aside to\\r\\nBursal.)  What a lump of family pride that Lord John is.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Keep out of my hearing, Wheeler, lest I should spoil sport.  But\\r\\nnever fear:  you\\'ll please Bursal sooner than I shall.  I can\\'t, for the\\r\\nsoul of me, bring myself to say that Bursal\\'s not purse-proud, and you\\r\\ncan.  Give you joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  A choice electioneerer!--ha! ha! ha!\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. (faintly).  He! he! he!--a choice electioneerer, as you say.\\r\\n          (Exeunt Wheeler and Bursal; manent Lord J. and Talbot.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  There was a time, Talbot--\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  There was a time, my lord--to save trouble and a long explanation-\\r\\n-there was a time when you liked Talbots better than spaniels; you\\r\\nunderstand me?\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  I have found it very difficult to understand you of late, Mr.\\r\\nTalbot.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Yes, because you have used other people\\'s understandings instead\\r\\nof your own.  Be yourself, my lord.  See with your own eyes, and hear\\r\\nwith your own ears, and then you\\'ll find me still, what I\\'ve been these\\r\\nseven years; not your understrapper, your hanger-on, your flatterer, but\\r\\nyour friend!  If you choose to have me for a friend, here\\'s my hand.  I\\r\\nam your friend, and you\\'ll not find a better.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J. (giving his hand).  You are a strange fellow, Talbot; I thought I\\r\\nnever could have forgiven you for what you said last night.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  What? for I don\\'t keep a register of my sayings.  Oh, it was\\r\\nsomething about gaming--Wheeler was flattering your taste for it, and he\\r\\nput me into a passion--I forget what I said.  But, whatever it was, I\\'m\\r\\nsure it was well meant, and I believe it was well said.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  But you laugh at me sometimes to my face.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Would you rather I should laugh at you behind your back?\\r\\n\\r\\nLord. J.  But of all things in the world I hate to be laughed at.  Listen\\r\\nto me, and don\\'t fumble in your pockets while I\\'m talking to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  I\\'m fumbling for--oh, here it is.  Now, Lord John, I once did\\r\\nlaugh at you behind your back, and what\\'s droll enough, it was at your\\r\\nback I laughed.  Here\\'s a caricature I drew of you--I really am sorry I\\r\\ndid it; but \\'tis best to show it to you myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J. (aside).  It is all I can do to forgive this.  (After a pause, he\\r\\ntears the paper.)  I have heard of this caricature before; but I did not\\r\\nexpect, Talbot, that you would come and show it to me, yourself, Talbot,\\r\\nso handsomely, especially at such a time as this.  Wheeler might well say\\r\\nyou are a bad electioneerer.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Oh, hang it!  I forgot my election, and your fifty-six friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         Enter RORY O\\'RYAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory (claps Talbot on the back).  Fifty-six friends, have you, Talbot?\\r\\nSay seven--fifty-seven, I mean; for I\\'ll lay you a wager, you\\'ve forget\\r\\nme; and that\\'s a shame for you, too; for out of the whole posse-comitatus\\r\\nentirely now, you have not a stauncher friend than Poor little Rory\\r\\nO\\'Ryan.  And a good right he has to befriend you; for you stood by him\\r\\nwhen many who ought to have known better were hunting him down for a wild\\r\\nIrishman.  Now that same wild Irishman has as much gratitude in him as\\r\\nany tame Englishman of them all.  But don\\'t let\\'s be talking sintimint;\\r\\nfor, for my share I\\'d not give a bogberry a bushel for sintimint, when I\\r\\ncould get anything better.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  And pray, sir, what may a bogberry be?\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Phoo! don\\'t be playing the innocent, now.  Where have you lived\\r\\nall your life (I ask pardon, my LARD) not to know a bogberry when you see\\r\\nor hear of it?  (Turns to Talbot.)  But what are ye standing idling here\\r\\nfor?  Sure, there\\'s Wheeler, and Bursal along with him, canvassing out\\r\\nyonder at a terrible fine rate.  And haven\\'t I been huzzaing for you\\r\\nthere till I\\'m hoarse?  So I am, and just stepped away to suck an orange\\r\\nfor my voice--(sucks an orange.)  I am a THOROUGH GOING friend, at\\r\\nanyrate.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Now, Rory, you are the best fellow in the world, and a THOROUGH\\r\\nGOING friend; but have a care, or you\\'ll get yourself and me into some\\r\\nscrape, before you have done with this violent THOROUGH GOING work.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Never fear! never fear, man!--a warm frind and a bitter enemy,\\r\\nthat\\'s my maxim.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Yes, but too warm a friend is as bad as a bitter enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Oh, never fear me!  I\\'m as cool as a cucumber all the time; and\\r\\nwhilst they tink I\\'m tinking of nothing in life but making a noise, I\\r\\nmake my own snug little remarks in prose and verse, as--now my voice is\\r\\nafter coming back to me, you shall hear, if you plase.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  I do please.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  I call it Rory\\'s song.  Now, mind, I have a verse for everybody--\\r\\no\\' the leading lads, I mean; and I shall put \\'em in or lave \\'em out,\\r\\naccording to their inclinations and deserts, wise-a-wee to you, my little\\r\\nfrind.  So you comprehend it will be Rory\\'s song, with variations.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalbot and Lord John.  Let\\'s have it; let\\'s have it without further\\r\\npreface.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Rory sings.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I\\'m true game to the last, and no WHEELER for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  There\\'s a stroke, in the first place, for Wheeler,--you take it?\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  O yes, yes, we take it; go on.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Rory sings.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I\\'m true game to the last, and no Wheeler for me.\\r\\n      Of all birds, beasts, or fishes, that swim in the sea,\\r\\n      Webb\\'d or finn\\'d, black or white, man or child, Whig or Tory,\\r\\n      None but Talbot, O, Talbot\\'s the dog for Rory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb. \"Talbot the dog\" is much obliged to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  But if I have any ear, one of your lines is a foot too long, Mr.\\r\\nO\\'Ryan.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Phoo, put the best foot foremost for a frind.  Slur it in the\\r\\nsinging, and don\\'t be quarrelling, anyhow, for a foot more or less.  The\\r\\nmore feet the better it will stand, you know.  Only let me go on, and\\r\\nyou\\'ll come to something that will plase you.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Rory sings.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Then there\\'s he with the purse that\\'s as long as my arm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  That\\'s Bursal, mind now, whom I mean to allude to in this verse.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  If the allusion\\'s good, we shall probably find out your meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  On with you, Rory, and don\\'t read us notes on a song.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Go on, and let us hear what you say of Bursal.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              Rory sings.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Then there\\'s he with the purse that\\'s as long as my arm;\\r\\n      His father\\'s a tanner,--but then where\\'s the harm?\\r\\n      Heir to houses, and hunters, and horseponds in fee,\\r\\n      Won\\'t his skins sure soon buy him a pedigree?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Encore! encore!  Why, Rory, I did not think you could make so\\r\\ngood a song.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Sure \\'twas none of I made it--\\'twas Talbot here.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  I!\\r\\n\\r\\nRory. (aside).  Not a word:  I\\'ll make you a present of it:  sure, then,\\r\\nit\\'s your own.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  I never wrote a word of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory. (to Lord J.).  Phoo, Phoo! he\\'s only denying it out of false\\r\\nmodesty.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord. J.  Well, no matter who wrote it,--sing it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Be easy; so I will, and as many more verses as you will to the\\r\\nback of it.  (Winking at Talbot aside.)  You shall have the credit of\\r\\nall.  (Aloud.)  Put me in when I\\'m out, Talbot, and you (to Lord John)\\r\\njoin--join.\\r\\n\\r\\n                Rory sings, and Lord John sings with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Then there\\'s he with the purse that\\'s as long as my arm;\\r\\n      His father\\'s a tanner,--but then where\\'s the harm?\\r\\n      Heir to houses, and hunters, and horseponds in fee,\\r\\n      Won\\'t his skins sure soon buy him a pedigree?\\r\\n      There\\'s my lord with the back that never was bent--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(Lord John stops singing; Talbot makes signs to Rory to stop; but Rory\\r\\ndoes not see him, and sings on.)\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"There\\'s my lord with the back that never was bent;\\r\\n      Let him live with his ancestors, I am content.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n                 (Rory pushes Lord J. and Talbot with his elbows.)\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Join, join, both of ye--why don\\'t you join?  (Sings.)\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Who\\'ll buy my Lord John? the arch fishwoman cried,\\r\\n      A nice oyster shut up in a choice shell of pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  But join or ye spoil all.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  You have spoiled all, indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J. (making a formal low bow).  Mr. Talbot, Lord John thanks you.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Lord John! blood and thunder!  I forgot you were by--quite and\\r\\nclean.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J. (puts him aside and continues speaking to Talbot).  Lord John\\r\\nthanks you, Mr. Talbot:  this is the second part of the caricature.  Lord\\r\\nJohn thanks you for these proofs of friendship--Lord John has reason to\\r\\nthank you, Mr. Talbot.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  No reason in life now.  Don\\'t be thanking so much for nothing in\\r\\nlife; or if you must be thanking of somebody, it\\'s me you ought to thank.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  I ought and do, sir, for unmasking one who--\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb. (warmly).  Unmasking, my lord--\\r\\n\\r\\nRory (holding them asunder).  Phoo! phoo! phoo! be easy, can\\'t ye?--\\r\\nthere\\'s no unmasking at all in the case.  My Lord John, Talbot\\'s writing\\r\\nthe song was all a mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  As much a mistake as your singing it, sir, I presume--\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Just as much.  \\'Twas all a mistake.  So now don\\'t you go and make\\r\\na mistake into a misunderstanding.  It was I made every word of the song\\r\\nout o\\' the face*--that about the back that never was bent, and the\\r\\nancestors of the oyster, and all.  He did not waste a word of it; upon my\\r\\nconscience, I wrote it all--though I\\'ll engage you didn\\'t think I could\\r\\nwrite a good thing.  (Lord John turns away.)  I\\'m telling you the truth,\\r\\nand not a word of a lie, and yet you won\\'t believe me.\\r\\n\\r\\n*From beginning to end.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  You will excuse me, sir, if I cannot believe two contradictory\\r\\nassertions within two minutes.  Mr. Talbot, I thank you (going).\\r\\n\\r\\n(Rory tries to stop Lord John from going, but cannot.--Exit Lord John.)\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Well, if he WILL go, let him go then, and much good may it do him.\\r\\nNay, but don\\'t you go too.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  O Rory, what have you done?--(Talbot runs after Lord J.)  Hear me,\\r\\nmy lord.                                 (Exit Talbot.)\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Hear him! hear him! hear him!--Well, I\\'m point blank mad with\\r\\nmyself for making this blunder; but how could I help it?  As sure as ever\\r\\nI am meaning to do the best thing on earth, it turns out the worst.\\r\\n\\r\\n                Enter a party of lads, huzzaing.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory (joins.)  Huzza! huzza!--Who, pray, are ye huzzaing for?\\r\\n\\r\\n1st Boy.  Wheeler! Wheeler for ever! huzza!\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Talbot! Talbot for ever! huzza!  Captain Talbot for ever! huzza!\\r\\n\\r\\n2nd Boy.  CAPTAIN he\\'ll never be,--at least not to-morrow; for Lord John\\r\\nhas just declared for Wheeler.\\r\\n\\r\\nlst Boy.  And that turns the scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Oh, the scale may turn back again.\\r\\n\\r\\n3rd Boy.  Impossible!  Lord John has just given his promise to Wheeler.\\r\\nI heard him with my own ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Several speak at once.)  And I heard him; and I! and I! and I!--Huzza!\\r\\nWheeler for ever!\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Oh, murder! murder! murder!  (Aside.)  This goes to my heart! it\\'s\\r\\nall my doing.  O, my poor Talbot!-- murder! murder! murder!  But I won\\'t\\r\\nlet them see me cast down, and it is good to be huzzaing at all events.\\r\\nHuzza for Talbot!  Talbot for ever! huzza!      (Exit.)\\r\\n\\r\\n                     Enter WHEELER and BURSAL.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Who was that huzzaing for Talbot?\\r\\n\\r\\n(Rory behind the scenes, \"Huzza for Talbot! Talbot for ever! huzza!\")\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Pooh, it is only Rory O\\'Ryan, or the roaring lion as I call him.\\r\\nHa! ha! ha!  Rory O\\'Ryan, alias O\\'Ryan, the roaring lion; that\\'s a good\\r\\none; put it about--Rory O\\'Ryan, the roaring lion, ha! ha! ha! but you\\r\\ndon\\'t take it--you don\\'t laugh, Wheeler.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheeler.  Ha! ha! ha!  O, upon my honour I do laugh; ha! ha! ha!\\r\\n(Aside).  It is the hardest work to laugh at his wit.  (Aloud.)  Rory\\r\\nO\\'Ryan, the roaring lion--ha! ha! ha!  You know I always laugh, Bursal,\\r\\nat your jokes--he! he! he!--ready to kill myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (sullenly).  You are easily killed, then, if that much laughing\\r\\nwill do the business.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. (coughing).  Just then--something stuck in my throat; I beg your\\r\\npardon.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (still sullen).  Oh, you need not beg my pardon about the matter.\\r\\nI don\\'t care whether you laugh or no--not I.  Now you have got Lord John\\r\\nto declare for you, you are above laughing at my jokes, I suppose.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  No, upon my word and honour, I DID laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (aside).  A fig for your word and honour.  (Aloud.)  I know I\\'m of\\r\\nno consequence now;  but you\\'ll remember, that if his lordship has the\\r\\nhonour of making you captain, he must have the honour to pay for your\\r\\ncaptain\\'s accoutrements; for I sha\\'n\\'t pay the piper, I promise you,\\r\\nsince I\\'m of no consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Of no consequence!  But, my dear Bursal, what could put that into\\r\\nyour head? that\\'s the strangest, oddest fancy.  Of no consequence!\\r\\nBursal, of no consequence!  Why, everybody that knows anything--everybody\\r\\nthat has seen Bursal House--knows that you are of the greatest\\r\\nconsequence, my dear Bursal.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (taking out his watch, and opening it, looks at it).  No, I\\'m of no\\r\\nconsequence.  I wonder that rascal Finsbury is not come yet with the\\r\\ndresses (still looking at his watch).\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. (aside).  If Bursal takes it into his head not to lend me the\\r\\nmoney to pay for my captain\\'s dress, what will become of me? for I have\\r\\nnot a shilling--and Lord John won\\'t pay for me--and Finsbury has orders\\r\\nnot to leave the house till he is paid by everybody.  What will become of\\r\\nme?--(bites his nails).\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (aside).  How I love to make him bite his nails!  (Aloud.)  I know\\r\\nI\\'m of no consequence.  (Strikes his repeater.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  What a fine repeater that is of yours, Bursal!  It is the best I\\r\\never heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  So it well may be; for it cost a mint of money.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  No matter to you what anything costs.  Happy dog as you are!  You\\r\\nroll in money; and yet you talk of being of no consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  But I am not of half so much consequence as Lord John--am I?\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Are you?  Why, aren\\'t you twice as rich as he!\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Very true, but I\\'m not purse-proud.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  You purse-proud!  I should never have thought of such a thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Nor I, if Talbot had not used the word.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  But Talbot thinks everybody purse-proud that has a purse.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (aside).  Well, this Wheeler does put one into a good humour with\\r\\none\\'s self in spite of one\\'s teeth.  (Aloud.)  Talbot says blunt things;\\r\\nbut I don\\'t think he\\'s what you can call clever--hey, Wheeler?\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Clever?  Oh, not he.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  I think I could walk round him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  To be sure you could.  Why, do you know, I\\'ve quizzed him\\r\\nfamously myself within this quarter of an hour!\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Indeed! I wish I had been by.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  So do I, \\'faith!  It was the best thing.  I wanted, you see, to\\r\\nget him out of my way, that I might have the field clear for\\r\\nelectioneering to-day.  So I bowls up to him with a long face--such a\\r\\nface as this.  Mr. Talbot, do you know--I\\'m sorry to tell you, here\\'s\\r\\nJack Smith has just brought the news from Salt Hill.  Your mother, in\\r\\ngetting into the carriage, slipped, and has BROKE her leg, and there\\r\\nshe\\'s lying at a farmhouse, two miles off.  Is not it true, Jack? said I.\\r\\nI saw the farmer helping her in with my own eyes, cries Jack.  Off goes\\r\\nTalbot like an arrow.  Quizzed him, quizzed him! said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Ha! ha! ha! quizzed him indeed, with all his cleverness; that was\\r\\nfamously done.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Ha! ha! ha!  With all his cleverness he will be all the evening\\r\\nhunting for the farmhouse and the mother that has broke her leg; so he is\\r\\nout of our way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  But what need have you to want him out of your way, now Lord John\\r\\nhas come over to your side?  You have the thing at a dead beat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Not so dead either; for there\\'s a great independent party, you\\r\\nknow; and if YOU don\\'t help me, Bursal, to canvass them, I shall be no\\r\\ncaptain.  It is you I depend upon after all.  Will you come and canvass\\r\\nthem with me?  Dear Bursal, pray--all depends upon you.\\r\\n\\r\\n                (Pulls him by the arm--Bursal follows.)\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Well, if all depends upon me, I\\'ll see what I can do for you.\\r\\n(Aside.)  Then I am of some consequence!  Money makes a man of some\\r\\nconsequence, I see; at least with some folks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the back scene a flock of sheep are seen penned.  In front, a party of\\r\\ncountry lads and lasses, gaily dressed, as in sheep-shearing time, with\\r\\nribands and garlands of flowers, etc., are dancing and singing.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter PATTY, dressed as the Queen of the Festival, with a lamb in her\\r\\narms.  The dancers break off when she comes in, and direct their\\r\\nattention towards her.\\r\\n\\r\\n1st Peasant.  Oh, here comes Patty!  Here comes the Queen o\\' the day.\\r\\nWhat has kept you from us so long, Patty?\\r\\n\\r\\n2nd Peasant.  \"Please your Majesty,\" you should say.\\r\\n\\r\\nPatty.  This poor little lamb of mine was what kept me so long.  It\\r\\nstrayed away from the rest; and I should have lost him, so I should, for\\r\\never, if it had not been for a good young gentleman.  Yonder he is,\\r\\ntalking to Farmer Hearty.  That\\'s the young gentleman who pulled my lamb\\r\\nout of the ditch for me, into which he had fallen--pretty creature!\\r\\n\\r\\n1st Peasant.  Pretty creature--or, your Majesty, whichever you choose to\\r\\nbe called--come and dance with them, and I\\'ll carry your lamb.\\r\\n                                (Exeunt, singing and dancing.)\\r\\n\\r\\n                 Enter FARMER HEARTY and TALBOT.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarmer.  Why, young gentleman, I\\'m glad I happened to light upon you\\r\\nhere, and so to hinder you from going farther astray, and set your heart\\r\\nat ease like.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Thanks, good farmer, you have set my heart at ease, indeed.  But\\r\\nthe truth is, they did frighten me confoundedly--more fool I.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  No fool at all, to my notion.  I should, at your age, ay, or at my\\r\\nage, just the self-same way have been frightened myself, if so be that\\r\\nmention had been made to me, that way, of my own mother\\'s having broke\\r\\nher leg or so.  And greater, by a great deal, the shame for them that\\r\\nfrighted you, than for you to be frighted.  How young gentlemen, now, can\\r\\nbring themselves for to tell such lies, is to me, now, a matter of\\r\\namazement, like, that I can\\'t noways get over.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Oh, farmer, such lies are very witty, though you and I don\\'t just\\r\\nnow like the wit of them.  This is fun, this is quizzing; but you don\\'t\\r\\nknow what we young gentlemen mean by quizzing.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  Ay, but I do though, to my cost, ever since last year.  Look you,\\r\\nnow, at yon fine field of wheat.  Well, it was just as fine, and finer,\\r\\nlast year, till a young Eton jackanapes--\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Take care what you say, farmer; for I am a young Eton jackanapes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  No; but you be not the young Eton jackanapes that I\\'m a-thinking\\r\\non.  I tell you it was this time last year, man; he was a-horseback, I\\r\\ntell ye, mounted upon a fine bay hunter, out a-hunting, like.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  I tell you it was this time last year, man, that I was mounted\\r\\nupon a fine bay hunter, out a-hunting.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  Zooks! would you argufy a man out of his wits?  You won\\'t go for\\r\\nto tell me that you are that impertinent little jackanapes!\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  No! no!  I\\'ll not tell you that I am an impertinent little\\r\\njackanapes!\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm (wiping his forehead).  Well, don\\'t then, for I can\\'t believe it;\\r\\nand you put me out.  Where was I?\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Mounted upon a fine bay hunter.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  Ay, so he was.  \"Here, YOU,\" says he, meaning me--\"open this gate\\r\\nfor me.\"  Now, if he had but a-spoke me fair, I would not have gainsaid\\r\\nhim:  but he falls to swearing, so I bid him open the gate for himself.\\r\\n\"There\\'s a bull behind you, farmer,\" says he.  I turns.  \"Quizzed him!\"\\r\\ncries my jackanapes, and off he gallops him, through the very thick of my\\r\\ncorn; but he got a fall, leaping the ditch out yonder, which pacified me,\\r\\nlike, at the minute.  So I goes up to see whether he was killed; but he\\r\\nwas not a whit the worse for his tumble.  So I should ha\\' fell into a\\r\\npassion with him then, to be sure, about my corn; but his horse had got\\r\\nsuch a terrible sprain, I couldn\\'t say anything to him; for I was a-\\r\\npitying the poor animal.  As fine a hunter as ever you saw!  I am sartain\\r\\nsure he could never come to good after.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb. (aside).  I do think, from the description, that this was Wheeler;\\r\\nand I have paid for the horse which he spoiled!  (Aloud.) Should you know\\r\\neither the man or the horse again, if you were to see them?\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  Ay, that I should, to my dying day.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Will you come with me, then, and you\\'ll do me some guineas\\' worth\\r\\nof service?\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  Ay, that I will, with a deal of pleasure; for you be a civil\\r\\nspoken young gentleman; and, besides, I don\\'t think the worse on you for\\r\\nbeing FRIGHTED a little about your mother; being what I might ha\\' been,\\r\\nat your age, myself; for I had a mother myself once.  So lead on, master.\\r\\n(Exeunt.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                         END OF THE SECOND ACT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                              ACT THE THIRD.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE I.\\r\\n\\r\\n             The garden of the \"Windmill Inn,\" at Salt Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\n           MISS BURSAL, MRS. NEWINGTON, SALLY, the Chambermaid.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Miss Bursal, in a fainting state, is sitting on a garden stool, and\\r\\nleaning her head against the Landlady.  Sally is holding a glass of water\\r\\nand a smelling bottle.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bursal.  Where am I?  Where am I?\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  At the \"Windmill,\" at Salt Hill, young lady; and ill or well,\\r\\nyou can\\'t be better.\\r\\n\\r\\nSally.  Do you find yourself better since coming into the air, miss?\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss B.  Better!  Oh, I shall never be better!\\r\\n (Leans her head on hand, and rocks herself backwards and forwards.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady.  My dear young lady, don\\'t take on so.  (Aside.)  Now would I\\r\\ngive something to know what it was my Lady Piercefield said to the\\r\\nfather, and what the father said to this one, and what\\'s the matter at\\r\\nthe bottom of affairs.  Sally, did you hear anything at the doors?\\r\\n\\r\\nSally (aside).  No, indeed, ma\\'am; I never BE\\'S at the doors.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady (aside).  Simpleton!  (Aloud.)  But, my dear Miss Bursal, if I\\r\\nmay be so bold--if you\\'d only disembosom your mind of what\\'s on it--\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss B.  Disembosom my mind!  Nonsense!  I\\'ve nothing on my mind.  Pray\\r\\nleave me, madam.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlady (aside).  Madam, indeed! madam, forsooth!  Oh, I\\'ll make her pay\\r\\nfor that!  That MADAM shall go down in the bill, as sure as my name\\'s\\r\\nNewington.  (Landlady, in a higher tone.)  Well, I wish you better,\\r\\nma\\'am.  I suppose I\\'d best send your own servant?\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss B. (sullenly).  Yes, I suppose so.  (To Sally.)  You need not wait,\\r\\nchild, nor look so curious.\\r\\n\\r\\nSally.  CUR\\'OUS!  Indeed, miss, if I look a little CUR\\'OUS, or so\\r\\n(looking at her dress), \\'tis only because I was FRIGHTED to see you take\\r\\non, which made me forget my clean apron, when I came out; and this apron-\\r\\n-\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss B.  Hush!  Hush! child.  Don\\'t tell me about clean aprons, nor run\\r\\non with your vulgar talk.  Is there ever a seat one can set on in that\\r\\n_H_arbour yonder?\\r\\n\\r\\nSally.  O dear \\'ART, yes, miss; \\'tis the pleasantest _H_arbour on\\r\\n_H_earth.  Be pleased to lean on my _H_arm, and you\\'ll soon be there.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss B. (going).  Then tell my woman she need not come to me, and let\\r\\nnobody INTERUDE on me--do you \\'EAR?  (Aside.)  Oh, what will become of\\r\\nme? and the Talbots will soon know it!  And the ponies, and the curricle,\\r\\nand the vis-a-vis--what will become of them? and how shall I make my\\r\\nappearance at the Montem, or any WARE else?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II.\\r\\n\\r\\n                LORD JOHN--WHEELER--BURSAL.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheeler.  Well, but my lord--Well, but Bursal--though my Lady\\r\\nPiercefield--though Miss Bursal is come to Salt Hill, you won\\'t leave us\\r\\nall at sixes and sevens.  What can we do without you?\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  You can do very well without me.\\r\\n\\r\\nBursal.  You can do very well without me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  (to Burs.).  Impossible!--impossible! You know Mr. Finsbury will\\r\\nbe here just now, with the dresses; and we have to try them on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  And to pay for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  And to settle about the procession.  And then, my lord, the\\r\\nelection is to come on this evening.  You won\\'t go till that\\'s over, as\\r\\nyour lordship has PROMISED me your lordship\\'s vote and interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  My vote I promised you, Mr. Wheeler; but I said not a syllable\\r\\nabout my INTEREST.  My friends, perhaps, have not been offended, though I\\r\\nhave, by Mr. Talbot.  I shall leave them to their own inclinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  (whistling).  Wheugh! wheugh! wheugh!  Wheeler, the principal\\'s\\r\\nnothing without the interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Oh, the interest will go along with the principal, of course; for\\r\\nI\\'m persuaded, if my lord leaves his friends to their inclinations, it\\r\\nwill be the inclination of my lord\\'s friends to vote as he does, if he\\r\\nsays nothing to them to the contrary.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  I told you, Mr. Wheeler, that I should leave them to themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (still whistling).  Well, I\\'ll do my best to make that father of\\r\\nmine send me off to Oxford.  I\\'m sure I\\'m fit to go--along with Wheeler.\\r\\nWhy, you\\'d best be my tutor, Wheeler!--a devilish good thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  An excellent thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  And a cursed fine dust we should kick up at Oxford, with your\\r\\nMontem money and all!--Money\\'s THE GO after all.  I wish it was come to\\r\\nmy making you my last bow, \"ye distant spires, ye ANTIC towers!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  (aside to Lord J.).  Ye ANTIC towers!--fit for Oxford, my lord!\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Antique towers, I suppose Mr. Bursal means.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Antique, to be sure!--I said antique, did not I, Wheeler?\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  O, yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J. (aside).  What a mean animal is this!\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter RORY O\\'RYAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Why, now, what\\'s become of Talbot, I want to know?  There he is\\r\\nnot to be found anywhere in the wide world; and there\\'s a hullabaloo\\r\\namongst his friends for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n                (Wheeler and Bursal wink at one another.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  We know nothing of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  I have not the honour, sir, to be one of Mr. Talbot\\'s friends.\\r\\nIt is his own fault, and I am sorry for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  \\'Faith, so am I, especially as it is mine--fault I mean; and\\r\\nespecially as the election is just going to come on.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter a party of boys, who cry, Finsbury\\'s come!--Finsbury\\'s come with\\r\\nthe dresses!\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Finsbury\\'s come?  Oh, let us see the dresses, and let us try \\'em\\r\\non to-night.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (pushing the crowd).  On with ye--on with ye, there!--Let\\'s try \\'em\\r\\non!--Try \\'em on--I\\'m to be colonel.\\r\\n\\r\\nlst Boy.  And I lieutenant.\\r\\n\\r\\n2nd Boy.  And I ensign.\\r\\n\\r\\n3rd Boy.  And I college salt-bearer.\\r\\n\\r\\n4th Boy.  And I oppidan.\\r\\n\\r\\n5th Boy.  Oh, what a pity I\\'m in mourning.\\r\\n\\r\\n                       Several speak at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we are servitors.  We are to be the eight servitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  And I am to be your Captain, I hope.  Come on, my Colonel.  (To\\r\\nBursal).  My lord, you are coming?\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  By-and-by--I\\'ve a word in his ear, by your LAVE and his.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Why, what the devil stops the way, there?--Push on--on with them.\\r\\n\\r\\n6th Boy.  I\\'m marshal.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  On with you--on with you--who cares what you are?\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. (to Bursal, aside).  You\\'ll pay Finsbury for me, you rich Jew?\\r\\n(To Lord John.)  Your lordship will remember your lordship\\'s promise.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  I do not usually forget my promises, sir; and therefore need not\\r\\nto be reminded of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  I beg pardon--I beg ten thousand pardons, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (taking him by the arm).  Come on, man, and don\\'t stand begging\\r\\npardon there, or I\\'ll leave you.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. (to Burs.) I beg pardon, Bursal--I beg pardon, ten thousand times.\\r\\n(Exeunt.)\\r\\n\\r\\n               Manent LORD JOHN and RORY O\\'RYAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Wheugh!--Now put the case.  If I was going to be hanged, for the\\r\\nlife of me I couldn\\'t be after begging so many pardons for nothing at\\r\\nall.  But many men, many minds--(Hums.)  True game to the last!  No\\r\\nWheeler for me.  Oh, murder! I forgot, I was nigh letting the cat out o\\'\\r\\nthe bag again.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  You had something to say to me, sir?  I wait till your\\r\\nrecollection returns.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  \\'Faith, and that\\'s very kind of you; and if you had always done\\r\\nso, you would never have been offended with me, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  You are mistaken, Mr. O\\'Ryan, if you think that you did or could\\r\\noffend me.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Mistaken was I, then, sure enough; but we are all liable to\\r\\nmistakes, and should forget and forgive one another; that\\'s the way to go\\r\\nthrough.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  You will go through the world your own way, Mr. O\\'Ryan, and\\r\\nallow me to go through it my way.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Very fair--fair enough--then we shan\\'t cross.  But now, to come to\\r\\nthe point.  I don\\'t like to be making disagreeable retrospects, if I\\r\\ncould any way avoid it; nor to be going about the bush, especially at\\r\\nthis time o\\' day; when, as Mr. Finsbury\\'s come, we\\'ve not so much time to\\r\\nlose as we had.  Is there any truth, then, my lord, in the report that is\\r\\ngoing about this hour past, that you have gone in a huff, and given your\\r\\npromise there to that sneaking Wheeler to vote for him now?\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  In answer to your question, sir, I am to inform you that I HAVE\\r\\npromised Mr. Wheeler to vote for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  In a huff?--Ay, now, there it is!--Well, when a man\\'s MAD, to be\\r\\nsure, he\\'s mad--and that\\'s all that can be said about it.  And I know, if\\r\\nI had been MAD myself, I might have done a foolish thing as well as\\r\\nanother.  But now, my lord, that you are not mad--\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  I protest, sir, I cannot understand you.  In one word, sir, I\\'m\\r\\nneither mad nor a fool!--Your most obedient (going, angrily).\\r\\n\\r\\nRory (holding him).  Take care now; you are going mad with me again.  But\\r\\nphoo! I like you the better for being mad.  I\\'m very often mad myself,\\r\\nand I would not give a potato for one that had never been mad in his\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J. (aside).  He\\'ll not be quiet, till he makes me knock him down.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Agh! agh! agh!--I begin to guess whereabouts I am at last.  MAD,\\r\\nin your country, I take it, means fit for Bedlam; but with us in Ireland,\\r\\nnow, \\'tis no such thing; it mean\\'s nothing in life but the being in a\\r\\npassion.  Well, one comfort is, my lord, as you\\'re a bit of a scholar, we\\r\\nhave the Latin proverb in our favour--\"Ira furor brevis est\"  (Anger is\\r\\nshort madness).  The shorter the better, I think.  So, my lord, to put an\\r\\nend to whatever of the kind you may have felt against poor Talbot, I\\'ll\\r\\nassure you he\\'s as innocent o\\' that unfortunate song as the babe unborn.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  It is rather late for Mr. Talbot to make apologies to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  He make apologies!  Not he, \\'faith; he\\'d send me to Coventry, or,\\r\\nmaybe, to a worse place, did he but know I was condescending to make this\\r\\nbit of explanation, unknown to him.  But, upon my conscience, I\\'ve a\\r\\nregard for you both, and don\\'t like to see you go together by the ears.\\r\\nNow, look you, my lord.  By this book, and all the books that were ever\\r\\nshut and opened, he never saw or heard of that unlucky song of mine till\\r\\nI came out with it this morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  But you told me this morning that it was he who wrote it.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  For that I take shame to myself, as it turned out; but it was only\\r\\na WHITE lie to SARVE a friend, and make him cut a dash with a new song at\\r\\nelection time.  But I\\'ve done for ever with white lies.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J. (walking about as if agitated).  I wish you had never begun with\\r\\nthem, Mr. O\\'Ryan.  This may be a good joke to you; but it is none to me\\r\\nor Talbot.  So Talbot never wrote a word of the song?\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Not a word or syllable, good or bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  And I have given my promise to vote against him.  He\\'ll lose his\\r\\nelection.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Not if you\\'ll give me leave to speak to your friends in your name.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  I have promised to leave them to themselves; and Wheeler, I am\\r\\nsure, has engaged them by this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Bless my body!  I\\'ll not stay prating here then.\\r\\n                                               (Exit Rory.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J. (follows).  But what can have become of Talbot?  I have been too\\r\\nhasty for once in my life.  Well, I shall suffer for it more than anybody\\r\\nelse; for I love Talbot, since he did not make the song, of which I hate\\r\\nto think.                        (Exit.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III.\\r\\n\\r\\nA large hall in Eton College--A staircase at the end--Eton lads, dressed\\r\\nin their Montem Dresses in the Scene--In front, WHEELER (dressed as\\r\\nCaptain), BURSAL and FINSBURY.\\r\\n\\r\\nFins.  I give you infinite credit, Mr. Wheeler, for this dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  INFINITE CREDIT!  Why, he\\'ll have no objection to that--hey,\\r\\nWheeler?  But I thought Finsbury knew you too well to give you credit for\\r\\nanything.\\r\\n\\r\\nFins.  You are pleased to be pleasant, sir.  Mr. Wheeler knows, in that\\r\\nsense of the word, it is out of my power to give him credit, and I\\'m sure\\r\\nhe would not ask it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. (aside).  O, Bursal, pay him, and I\\'ll pay you tomorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Now, if you weren\\'t to be captain after all, Wheeler, what a\\r\\npretty figure you\\'d cut.  Ha! ha! ha!--Hey?\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  Oh, I am as sure of being captain as of being alive.  (Aside.) Do\\r\\npay for me, now, there\\'s a good, dear fellow, before THEY (looking back)\\r\\ncome up.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs. (aside).  I love to make him lick the dust.  (Aloud.)  Hollo!\\r\\nhere\\'s Finsbury waiting to be paid, lads.  (To the lads who are in the\\r\\nback scene.)  Who has paid, and who has not paid, I say?\\r\\n\\r\\n(The lads come forward, and several exclaim at once,) I\\'ve paid!  I\\'ve\\r\\npaid!\\r\\n\\r\\n                   Enter LORD JOHN and RORY O\\'RYAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Oh, King of Fashion, how fine we are!  Why, now, to look at ye all\\r\\none might fancy one\\'s self at the playhouse at once, or at a fancy ball\\r\\nin dear little Dublin.  Come, strike up a dance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Pshaw!  Wherever you come, Rory O\\'Ryan, no one else can be heard.\\r\\nWho has paid, and who has not paid, I say?\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral Boys exclaim.  We\\'ve all paid.\\r\\n\\r\\n1st Boy.  I\\'ve not paid, but here\\'s my money.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral Boys.  We have not paid, but here\\'s our money.\\r\\n\\r\\n6th Boy.  Order there, I am marshal.  All that have paid march off to the\\r\\nstaircase, and take your seats there, one by one.  March!\\r\\n\\r\\n(As they march by, one by one, so as to display their dresses, Mr.\\r\\nFinsbury bows, and says,)\\r\\n\\r\\nA thousand thanks, gentlemen.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Thanks, gentlemen.\\r\\nThe finest sight ever I saw out of Lon\\'on.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory, as each lad passes, catches his arm, Are you a TalbotITE or a\\r\\nWheelerITE?  To each who answers \"A Wheelerite,\" Rory replies, \"Phoo!\\r\\ndance off, then.  Go to the devil and shake yourself.\"*   Each who\\r\\nanswers \"A Talbotite,\" Rory shakes by the hand violently, singing,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Talbot, oh, Talbot\\'s the dog for Rory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n*This is the name of a country dance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they have almost all passed, Lord John says, But where can Mr.\\r\\nTalbot be all this time?\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Who knows?  Who cares?\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  A pretty electioneerer!  (Aside to Bursal.)  Finsbury\\'s waiting\\r\\nto be paid.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  You don\\'t wait for me, Mr. Finsbury.  You know, I have settled\\r\\nwith you.\\r\\n\\r\\nFins.  Yes, my lord--yes.  Many thanks:  and I have left your lordship\\'s\\r\\ndress here, and everybody\\'s dress, I believe, as bespoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Here, Finsbury, is the money for Wheeler, who, between you and me,\\r\\nis as poor as a rat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheeler (affecting to laugh.).  Well, I hope I shall be as rich as a Jew\\r\\nto-morrow.  (Bursal counts money, in an ostentatious manner, into\\r\\nFinsbury\\'s hand.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFins.  A thousand thanks for all favours.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  You will be kind enough to LAVE Mr. Talbot\\'s dress with me, Mr.\\r\\nFinsbury, for I\\'m a friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nFins.  Indubitably, sir:  but the misfortune is--he! he! he!--Mr. Talbot,\\r\\nsir, has bespoke no dress.  Your servant, gentlemen.\\r\\n                                           (Exit Finsbury.)\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  So your friend Mr. Talbot could not afford to bespeak a dress--\\r\\n(Bursal and Wheeler laugh insolently.)  How comes that, I wonder?\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  If I\\'m not mistaken, here comes Talbot to answer for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  But who, in the name of St. Patrick, has he along with him?\\r\\n\\r\\n                  Enter TALBOT and LANDLORD.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Come in along with us, Farmer Hearty--come in.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Whilst the Farmer comes in, the boys who were sitting on the stairs,\\r\\nrise and exclaim,)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhom have we here?  What now?  Come down, lads; here\\'s more fun.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  What\\'s here, Talbot?\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  An honest farmer, and a good natured landlord, who would come here\\r\\nalong with me to speak--\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm. (interrupting).  To speak the truth--(strikes his stick on the\\r\\nground).\\r\\n\\r\\nLandlord (unbuttoning his waistcoat).  But I am so hot--so short-winded,\\r\\nthat (panting and puffing)--that for the soul and body of me, I cannot\\r\\nsay what I have got for to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  \\'Faith, now, the more short winded a story, the better, to my\\r\\nfancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Wheeler, what\\'s the matter, man? you look as if your under jaw was\\r\\nbroke.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  The matter is, young gentlemen, that there was once upon a time a\\r\\nfine, bay hunter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel. (squeezing up to Talbot, aside).  Don\\'t expose me, don\\'t let him\\r\\ntell.  (To the Farmer.)  I\\'ll pay for the corn I spoiled.  (To the\\r\\nLandlord.)  I\\'ll pay for the horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  I does not want to be paid for my corn.  The short of it is, young\\r\\ngentlemen, this \\'un here, in the fine thing-em-bobs (pointing to\\r\\nWheeler), is a shabby fellow; he went and spoiled Master Newington\\'s best\\r\\nhunter.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand. (panting).  Ruinationed him! ruinationed him!\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  But was that all the shabbiness?  Now I might, or any of us might,\\r\\nhave had such an accident as that.  I suppose he paid the gentleman for\\r\\nthe horse, or will do so, in good time.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand. (holding his sides).  Oh, that I had but a little breath in this\\r\\nbody o\\' mine to speak all--speak on, Farmer.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm. (striking his stick on the floor).  Oons, sir, when a man\\'s put\\r\\nout, he can\\'t go on with his story.\\r\\n\\r\\nOmnes.  Be quiet, Rory--hush!     (Rory puts his finger on his lips.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  Why, sir, I was a-going to tell you the shabbiness--why, sir, he\\r\\ndid not pay the landlord, here, for the horse; but he goes and says to\\r\\nthe landlord, here--\"Mr. Talbot had your horse on the self-same day;\\r\\n\\'twas he did the damage; \\'tis from he you must get your money.\"  So Mr.\\r\\nTalbot, here, who is another sort of a gentleman (though he has not so\\r\\nfine a coat) would not see a man at a loss, that could not afford it; and\\r\\nnot knowing which of \\'em it was that spoiled the horse, goes, when he\\r\\nfinds the other would not pay a farthing, and pays all.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory (rubbing his hands).  There\\'s Talbot for ye.  And, now, gentlemen\\r\\n(to Wheeler and Bursal), you guess the RASON, as I do, I suppose, why he\\r\\nbespoke no dress; he had not money enough to be fine--and honest, too.\\r\\nYou are very fine, Mr. Wheeler, to do you justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Pray, Mr. O\\'Ryan, let the farmer go on; he has more to say.  How\\r\\ndid you find out, pray, my good friend, that it was not Talbot who\\r\\nspoiled the horse!  Speak loud enough to be heard by everybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarm.  Ay, that I will--I say (very loudly) I say I saw him there\\r\\n(pointing to Wheeler) take the jump which strained the horse; and I\\'m\\r\\nready to swear to it.  Yet he let another pay; there\\'s the shabbiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n(A general groan from all the lads.  \"Oh, shabby Wheeler, shabby!  I\\'ll\\r\\nnot vote for shabby Wheeler!\")\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J. (aside).  Alas! I must vote for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n                          Rory sings.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"True game to the last; no Wheeler for me;\\r\\n      Talbot, oh, Talbot\\'s the dog for me.\"\\r\\n                               (Several voices join the chorus.)\\r\\n\\r\\nBurs.  Wheeler, if you are not chosen Captain, you must see and pay me\\r\\nfor the dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nWheel.  I am as poor as a rat.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Oh, yes! oh yes! hear ye! hear ye, all manner of men--the election\\r\\nis now going to begin forthwith in the big field, and Rory O\\'Ryan holds\\r\\nthe poll for Talbot.  Talbot for ever!--huzza!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Exit Rory, followed by the Boys, who exclaim \"Talbot for ever!--huzza!\"\\r\\nThe Landlord and Farmer join them.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Talbot, I am glad you are what I always thought you--I\\'m glad\\r\\nyou did not write that odious song.  I would not lose such a friend for\\r\\nall the songs in the world.  Forgive me for my hastiness this morning.\\r\\nI\\'ve punished myself--I\\'ve promised to vote for Wheeler.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Oh, no matter whom you vote for, my lord, if you are still my\\r\\nfriend, and if you know me to be yours.      (They shake hands.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  I must not say, \"Huzza for Talbot!\"        (Exeunt.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE IV.\\r\\n\\r\\n                         WINDSOR TERRACE.\\r\\n\\r\\nLADY PIERCEFIELD, MRS. TALBOT, LOUISA, and a little girl of six years\\r\\nold, LADY VIOLETTA, daughter to LADY PIERCEFIELD.\\r\\n\\r\\nVioletta (looking at a paper which Louisa holds).  I like it VERY much.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady P.  What is it that you like VERY much, Violetta?\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet.  You are not to know yet, mamma; it is--I may tell her that--it\\r\\nis a little drawing that Louisa is doing for me.  Louisa, I wish you\\r\\nwould let me show it to mamma.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  And welcome, my dear; it is only a sketch of \"The Little\\r\\nMerchants,\" a story which Violetta was reading, and she asked me to try\\r\\nto draw the pictures of the little merchants for her.  (Whilst Lady P.\\r\\nlooks at the drawing, Violetta says to Louisa)\\r\\n\\r\\nBut are you in earnest, Louisa, about what you were saying to me just\\r\\nnow,--quite in earnest?\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  Yes, in earnest,--quite in earnest, my dear.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet.  And may I ask mamma, NOW?\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  If you please, my dear.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet. (runs to her mother).  Stoop down to me, mamma ; I\\'ve something\\r\\nto whisper to you.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Lady Piercefield stoops down; Violetta throws her arms round her\\r\\nmother\\'s neck.)\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet. (aside to her mother).  Mamma, do you know--you know you want a\\r\\ngoverness for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady P.  Yes, if I could find a good one.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet. (aloud).  Stoop again, mamma, I\\'ve more to whisper.  (Aside to\\r\\nher mother).  SHE says she will be my governess, if you please.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady P.  SHE!--who is SHE?\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet.  Louisa.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady P. (patting Violetta\\'s cheek).  You are a little fool.  Miss Talbot\\r\\nis only playing with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet.  No, indeed, mamma; she is in earnest; are not you, Louisa?--Oh,\\r\\nsay yes!\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet. (claps her hands).  YES, mamma; do you hear YES?\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  If Lady Piercefield will trust you to my care, I am persuaded\\r\\nthat I should be much happier as your governess, my good little Violetta,\\r\\nthan as an humble dependent of Miss Bursal\\'s.  (Aside to her mother.)\\r\\nYou see that, now I am put to the trial, I keep to my resolution, dear\\r\\nmother.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. T.  Your ladyship would not be surprised at this offer of my Louisa,\\r\\nif you had heard, as we have done within these few hours, of the loss of\\r\\nthe East India ship in which almost our whole property was embarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  The Bombay Castle is wrecked.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady P.  The Bombay Castle!  I have the pleasure to tell you that you are\\r\\nmisinformed--it was the Airly Castle that was wrecked.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa and Mrs. T.  Indeed!\\r\\n\\r\\nLady P.  Yes; you may depend upon it--it was the Airly Castle that was\\r\\nlost.  You know I am just come from Portsmouth, where I went to meet my\\r\\nbrother, Governor Morton, who came home with the last India fleet, and\\r\\nfrom whom I had the intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Here Violetta interrupts, to ask her mother for her nosegay--Lady P.\\r\\ngives it to her, then goes on speaking.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLady P.  They were in such haste, foolish people! to carry their news to\\r\\nLondon, that they mistook one castle for another.  But do you know that\\r\\nMr. Bursal loses fifty thousand pounds, it is said, by the Airly Castle!\\r\\nWhen I told him she was lost, I thought he would have dropped down.\\r\\nHowever, I found he comforted himself afterwards with a bottle of\\r\\nBurgundy:  but poor Miss Bursal has been in hysterics ever since.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. T.  Poor girl!  My Louisa, YOU did not fall into hysterics, when I\\r\\ntold you of the loss of our whole fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Violetta, during this dialogue, has been seated on the ground making up\\r\\na nosegay.)\\r\\n\\r\\nViolet. (aside).  Fall into hysterics!  What are hysterics, I wonder.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  Miss Bursal is much to be pitied; for the loss of wealth will be\\r\\nthe loss of happiness to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady P.  It is to be hoped that the loss may at least check the foolish\\r\\npride and extravagance of young Bursal, who, as my son tells me--\\r\\n\\r\\n               (A cry of \"Huzza! huzza!\" behind the scenes.)\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter LORD JOHN.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  (hastily).  How d\\'ye do, mother!  Miss Talbot, I give you joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady P.  Take breath--take breath.\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  It is my brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. T.  Here he is!--Hark! hark!\\r\\n\\r\\n      (A cry behind the scenes of \"Talbot and truth for ever! Huzza!\")\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa.  They are chairing him.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord J.  Yes, they are chairing him; and he has been chosen for his\\r\\nhonourable conduct, not for his electioneering skill; for, to do him\\r\\njustice, Coriolanus himself was not a worse electioneerer.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter RORY O\\'RYAN and another Eton lad, carrying TALBOT in a chair,\\r\\nfollowed by a crowd of Eton lads.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  By your LAVE, my lord--by your LAVE, ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\nOmnes.  Huzza!  Talbot and truth for ever!  Huzza!\\r\\n\\r\\nTalb.  Set me down!  There\\'s my mother!  There\\'s my sister!\\r\\n\\r\\nRory.  Easy, easy.  Set him down?  No such TING! give him t\\'other huzza!\\r\\nThere\\'s nothing like a good loud huzza in this world.  Yes, there is!\\r\\nfor, as my Lord John said just now, out of some book, or out of his own\\r\\nhead,--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"One self-approving hour whole years outweighs,\\r\\n      Of stupid starers and of loud huzzas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                           CURTAIN FALLS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFORGIVE AND FORGET.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the neighbourhood of a seaport town in the west of England, there\\r\\nlived a gardener, who had one son, called Maurice, to whom he was very\\r\\npartial.  One day his father sent him to the neighbouring town to\\r\\npurchase some garden seeds for him.  When Maurice got to the seed-shop,\\r\\nit was full of people, who were all impatient to be served:  first a\\r\\ngreat tall man, and next a great fat woman pushed before him; and he\\r\\nstood quietly beside the counter, waiting till somebody should be at\\r\\nleisure to attend to him.  At length, when all the other people who were\\r\\nin the shop had got what they wanted, the shopman turned to Maurice--\"And\\r\\nwhat do you want, my patient little fellow?\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want all these seeds for my father,\" said Maurice, putting a list of\\r\\nseeds into the shopman\\'s hand; \"and I have brought money to pay for them\\r\\nall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seedsman looked out all the seeds that Maurice wanted, and packed\\r\\nthem up in paper:  he was folding up some painted lady-peas, when, from a\\r\\ndoor at the back of the shop, there came in a square, rough-faced man,\\r\\nwho exclaimed, the moment he came in, \"Are the seeds I ordered ready?--\\r\\nThe wind\\'s fair--they ought to have been aboard yesterday.  And my china\\r\\njar, is it packed up and directed? where is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is up there on the shelf over your head, sir,\" answered the seedsman.\\r\\n\"It is very safe, you see; but we have not had time to pack it yet.  It\\r\\nshall be done to-day; and we will get the seeds ready for you, sir,\\r\\nimmediately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Immediately! then stir about it.  The seeds will not pack themselves up.\\r\\nMake haste, pray.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Immediately, sir, as soon as I have done up the parcel for this little\\r\\nboy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What signifies the parcel for this little boy?  He can wait, and I\\r\\ncannot--wind and tide wait for no man.  Here, my good lad, take your\\r\\nparcel, and sheer off,\" said the impatient man; and, as he spoke, he took\\r\\nup the parcel of seeds from the counter, as the shopman stooped to look\\r\\nfor a sheet of thick brown paper and packthread to tie it up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parcel was but loosely folded up, and as the impatient man lifted it,\\r\\nthe weight of the peas which were withinside of it burst the paper, and\\r\\nall the seeds fell out upon the floor, whilst Maurice in vain held his\\r\\nhands to catch them.  The peas rolled to all parts of the shop; the\\r\\nimpatient man swore at them, but Maurice, without being out of humour,\\r\\nset about collecting them as fast as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst the boy was busied in this manner, the man got what seeds he\\r\\nwanted; and as he was talking about them, a sailor came into the shop,\\r\\nand said, \"Captain, the wind has changed within these five minutes, and\\r\\nit looks as if we should have ugly weather.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'m glad of it,\" replied the rough faced man, who was the captain\\r\\nof a ship.  \"I am glad to have a day longer to stay ashore, and I\\'ve\\r\\nbusiness enough on my hands.\"  The captain pushed forward towards the\\r\\nshop door.  Maurice, who was kneeling on the floor, picking up his seeds,\\r\\nsaw that the captain\\'s foot was entangled in some packthread which hung\\r\\ndown from the shelf on which the china jar stood.  Maurice saw that, if\\r\\nthe captain took one more step forward, he must pull the string, so that\\r\\nit would throw down the jar, round the bottom of which the packthread was\\r\\nentangled.  He immediately caught hold of the captain\\'s leg, and stopped\\r\\nhim.  \"Stay!  Stand still, sir!\" said he, \"or you will break your china\\r\\njar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man stood still, looked, and saw how the packthread had caught in his\\r\\nshoe buckle, and how it was near dragging down his beautiful china jar.\\r\\n\"I am really very much obliged to you, my little fellow,\" said he.  \"You\\r\\nhave saved my jar, which I would not have broken for ten guineas, for it\\r\\nis for my wife, and I\\'ve brought it safe from abroad many a league.  It\\r\\nwould have been a pity if I had broken it just when it was safe landed.\\r\\nI am really much obliged to you, my little fellow, this was returning\\r\\ngood for evil.  I am sorry I threw down your seeds, as you are such a\\r\\ngood natured, forgiving boy.  Be so kind,\" continued he, turning to the\\r\\nshopman, \"as to reach down that china jar for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shopman lifted down the jar very carefully, and the captain took off\\r\\nthe cover, and pulled out some tulip roots.  \"You seem, by the quantity\\r\\nof seeds you have got, to belong to a gardener.  Are you fond of\\r\\ngardening?\" said he to Maurice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Maurice, \"very fond of it; for my father is a\\r\\ngardener, and he lets me help him at his work, and he has given me a\\r\\nlittle garden of my own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then here are a couple of tulip-roots for you; and if you take care of\\r\\nthem, I\\'ll promise you that you will have the finest tulips in England in\\r\\nyour little garden.  These tulips were given to me by a Dutch merchant,\\r\\nwho told me that they were some of the rarest and finest in Holland.\\r\\nThey will prosper with you, I\\'m sure, wind and weather permitting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMaurice thanked the gentleman, and returned home, eager to show his\\r\\nprecious tulip-roots to his father, and to a companion of his, the son of\\r\\na nurseryman, who lived near him.  Arthur was the name of the\\r\\nnurseryman\\'s son.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first thing Maurice did, after showing his tulip-roots to his father,\\r\\nwas to run to Arthur\\'s garden in search of him.  Their gardens were\\r\\nseparated only by a low wall of loose stones:  \"Arthur! Arthur! where are\\r\\nyou?  Are you in your garden!  I want you.\"  But Arthur made no answer,\\r\\nand did not, as usual, come running to meet his friend.  \"I know where\\r\\nyou are,\" continued Maurice, \"and I\\'m coming to you as fast as the\\r\\nraspberry-bushes will let me.  I have good news for you--something you\\'ll\\r\\nbe delighted to see, Arthur!--Ha!--but here is something that I am not\\r\\ndelighted to see, I am sure,\" said poor Maurice, who, when he had got\\r\\nthrough the raspberry-bushes, and had come in sight of his own garden,\\r\\nbeheld his bell-glass--his beloved bell-glass, under which his cucumbers\\r\\nwere grown so finely--his only bell-glass, broken to pieces!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry for it,\" said Arthur, who stood leaning upon his spade in his\\r\\nown garden; \"I am afraid you will be very angry with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, was it you, Arthur, broke my bell-glass!  Oh, how could you do so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was throwing weeds and rubbish over the wall, and by accident a great\\r\\nlump of couch-grass, with stones hanging to the roots, fell upon your\\r\\nbell-glass, and broke it, as you see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMaurice lifted up the lump of couch-grass, which had fallen through the\\r\\nbroken glass upon his cucumbers, and he looked at his cucumbers for a\\r\\nmoment in silence--\"Oh, my poor cucumbers! you must all die now.  I shall\\r\\nsee all your yellow flowers withered tomorrow; but it is done, and it\\r\\ncannot be helped; so, Arthur, let us say no more about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very good; I thought you would have been angry.  I am sure I\\r\\nshould have been exceedingly angry if you had broken the glass, if it had\\r\\nbeen mine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, forgive and forget, as my father always says; that\\'s the best way.\\r\\nLook what I have got for you.\"  Then he told Arthur the story of the\\r\\ncaptain of the ship, and the china jar; the seeds having been thrown\\r\\ndown, and of the fine tulip-roots which had been given to him; and\\r\\nMaurice concluded by offering one of the precious roots to Arthur, who\\r\\nthanked him with great joy, and repeatedly said, \"How good you were not\\r\\nto be angry with me for breaking your bell-glass!  I am much more sorry\\r\\nfor it than if you had been in a passion with me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur now went to plant his tulip-root:  and Maurice looked at the beds\\r\\nwhich his companion had been digging, and at all the things which were\\r\\ncoming up in his garden.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know how it is,\" said Arthur, \"but you always seem as glad to\\r\\nsee the things in my garden coming up, and doing well, as if they were\\r\\nall your own.  I am much happier since my father came to live here, and\\r\\nsince you and I have been allowed to work and to play together, than I\\r\\never was before; for you must know, before we came to live here, I had a\\r\\ncousin in the house with me, who used to plague me.  He was not nearly so\\r\\ngood-natured as you are.  He never took pleasure in looking at my garden,\\r\\nor at anything that I did that was well done; and he never gave me a\\r\\nshare of anything that he had; and so I did not like him; how could I?\\r\\nBut, I believe that hating people makes us unhappy; for I know I never\\r\\nwas happy when I was quarrelling with him; and I am always happy with\\r\\nyou, Maurice.  You know we never quarrel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be well for all the world if they could be convinced, like\\r\\nArthur, that to live in friendship is better than to quarrel.  It would\\r\\nbe well for all the world if they followed Maurice\\'s maxim of \"Forgive\\r\\nand Forget,\" when they receive, or when they imagine that they receive,\\r\\nan injury.\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur\\'s father, Mr. Oakly, the nurseryman, was apt to take offence at\\r\\ntrifles; and when he thought that any of his neighbours disobliged him,\\r\\nhe was too proud to ask them to explain their conduct; therefore he was\\r\\noften mistaken in his judgment of them.  He thought that it showed\\r\\nSPIRIT, to remember and to resent an injury; and, therefore, though he\\r\\nwas not an ill-natured man, he was sometimes led, by this mistaken idea\\r\\nof SPIRIT, to do ill-natured things:  \"A warm friend and a bitter enemy,\"\\r\\nwas one of his maxims, and he had many more enemies than friends.  He was\\r\\nnot very rich, but he was proud; and his favourite proverb was, \"Better\\r\\nlive in spite than in pity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen first he settled near Mr. Grant, the gardener, he felt inclined to\\r\\ndislike him, because he was told that Mr. Grant was a Scotchman, and he\\r\\nhad a prejudice against Scotchmen; all of whom he believed to be cunning\\r\\nand avaricious, because he had once been over-reached by a Scotch\\r\\npeddler.  Grant\\'s friendly manners in some degree conquered this\\r\\nprepossession but still he secretly suspected that THIS CIVILITY, as he\\r\\nsaid, \"was all show, and that he was not, nor could not, being a\\r\\nScotchman, be such a hearty friend as a true-born Englishman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGrant had some remarkably fine raspberries.  The fruit was so large, as\\r\\nto be quite a curiosity.  When it was in season, many strangers came from\\r\\nthe neighbouring town, which was a sea-bathing place, to look at these\\r\\nraspberries, which obtained the name of Brobdingnag raspberries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How came you, pray, neighbour Grant, if a man may ask, by these\\r\\nwonderful fine raspberries?\" said Mr. Oakly, one evening, to the\\r\\ngardener.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s a secret,\" replied Grant, with an arch smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, in case it\\'s a secret, I\\'ve no more to say; for I never meddle with\\r\\nany man\\'s secrets that he does not choose to trust me with.  But I wish,\\r\\nneighbour Grant, you would put down that book.  You are always poring\\r\\nover some book or another when a man comes to see you, which is not,\\r\\naccording to my notions (being a plain, UNLARNED Englishman bred and\\r\\nborn), so civil and neighbourly as might be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Grant hastily shut his book, but remarked, with a shrewd glance at\\r\\nhis son, that it was in that book he found his Brobdingnag raspberries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are pleased to be pleasant upon them that have not the luck to be as\\r\\nbook-LARNED as yourself, Mr. Grant; but I take it, being only a plain\\r\\nspoken Englishman, as I observed afore, that one is to the full as like\\r\\nto find a raspberry in one\\'s garden as in one\\'s book, Mr. Grant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGrant, observing that his neighbour spoke rather in a surly tone, did not\\r\\ncontradict him; being well versed in the Bible, he knew that \"A soft word\\r\\nturneth away wrath,\" and he answered, in a good humoured voice, \"I hear,\\r\\nneighbour Oakly, you are likely to make a great deal of money of your\\r\\nnursery this year.  Here\\'s to the health of you and yours, not forgetting\\r\\nthe seedling larches, which I see are coming on finely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank ye, neighbour, kindly; the larches are coming on tolerably well,\\r\\nthat\\'s certain; and here\\'s to your good health, Mr. Grant--you and yours,\\r\\nnot forgetting your, what dye call \\'em raspberries\"--(drinks)--and, after\\r\\na pause, resumes, \"I\\'m not apt to be a beggar, neighbour, but if you\\r\\ncould give me--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Mr. Oakly was interrupted by the entrance of some strangers, and he\\r\\ndid finish making his request--Mr. Oakly was not, as he said of himself,\\r\\napt to ask favours, and nothing but Grant\\'s cordiality could have\\r\\nconquered his prejudices, so far as to tempt him to ask a favour from a\\r\\nScotchman.  He was going to have asked for some of the Brobdingnag\\r\\nraspberry-plants.  The next day the thought of the raspberry-plants\\r\\nrecurred to his memory, but being a bashful man, he did not like to go\\r\\nhimself on purpose to make his request, and he desired his wife, who was\\r\\njust setting out to market, to call at Grant\\'s gate, and, if he was at\\r\\nwork in his garden, to ask him for a few plants of his raspberries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer which Oakly\\'s wife brought to him was that Mr. Grant had not a\\r\\nraspberry-plant in the world to give him, and that if he had ever so\\r\\nmany, he would not give one away, except to his own son.\\r\\n\\r\\nOakly flew into a passion when he received such a message, declared it\\r\\nwas just such a mean, shabby trick as might have been expected from a\\r\\nScotchman--called himself a booby, a dupe, and a blockhead, for ever\\r\\nhaving trusted to the civil speeches of a Scotchman--swore that he would\\r\\ndie in the parish workhouse before he would ever ask another favour, be\\r\\nit ever so small, from a Scotchman; related to his wife, for the\\r\\nhundredth time, the way in which he had been taken in by the Scotch\\r\\npeddler ten years ago, and concluded by forswearing all further\\r\\nintercourse with Mr. Grant, and all belonging to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Son Arthur,\" said he, addressing himself to the boy, who just then came\\r\\nin from work--\"Son Arthur, do you hear me? let me never again see you\\r\\nwith Grant\\'s son.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With Maurice, father?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With Maurice Grant, I say; I forbid you from this day and hour forward\\r\\nto have anything to do with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, why, dear father?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ask no questions but do as I bid you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur burst out a crying, and only said, \"Yes, father, I\\'ll do as you\\r\\nbid me, to be sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why now, what does the boy cry for?  Is there no other boy, simpleton,\\r\\nthink you, to play with, but this Scotchman\\'s son!  I\\'ll find out another\\r\\nplay-fellow for ye, child, if that be all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s not all, father,\" said Arthur, trying to stop himself from\\r\\nsobbing; \"but the thing is, I shall never have such another play-fellow,-\\r\\n-I shall never have such another friend as Maurice Grant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Like father like son--you may think yourself well off to have done with\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Done with him!  Oh, father, and shall I never go again to work in his\\r\\ngarden, and may not he come to mine?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Oakly, sturdily; \"his father has used me uncivil, and no\\r\\nman shall use me uncivil twice.  I say no.  Wife, sweep up this hearth.\\r\\nBoy, don\\'t take on like a fool; but eat thy bacon and greens, and let\\'s\\r\\nhear no more of Maurice Grant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur promised to obey his father.  He only begged that he might once\\r\\nmore speak to Maurice, and tell him that it was by his father\\'s orders he\\r\\nacted.  This request was granted; but when Arthur further begged to know\\r\\nwhat reason he might give for this separation, his father refused to tell\\r\\nhis reasons.  The two friends took leave of one another very sorrowfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Grant, when he heard of all this, endeavoured to discover what could\\r\\nhave offended his neighbour; but all explanation was prevented by the\\r\\nobstinate silence of Oakly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the message which Grant really sent about the Brobdingnag\\r\\nraspberries was somewhat different from that which Mr. Oakly received.\\r\\nThe message was, that the raspberries were not Mr. Grant\\'s; that\\r\\ntherefore he had no right to give them away; that they belonged to his\\r\\nson Maurice, and that this was not the right time of year for planting\\r\\nthem.  This message had been unluckily misunderstood.  Grant gave his\\r\\nanswer to his wife; she to a Welsh servant-girl, who did not perfectly\\r\\ncomprehend her mistress\\' broad Scotch; and she in her turn could not make\\r\\nherself intelligible to Mrs. Oakly, who hated the Welsh accent, and whose\\r\\nattention, when the servant-girl delivered the message, was principally\\r\\nengrossed by the management of her own horse.  The horse, on which Mrs.\\r\\nOakly rode this day being ill-broken, would not stand still quietly at\\r\\nthe gate, and she was extremely impatient to receive her answer, and to\\r\\nride on to market.\\r\\n\\r\\nOakly, when he had once resolved to dislike his neighbour Grant, could\\r\\nnot long remain without finding out fresh causes of complaint.  There was\\r\\nin Grant\\'s garden a plum-tree, which was planted close to the loose stone\\r\\nwall that divided the garden from the nursery.  The soil in which the\\r\\nplum tree was planted happened not to be quite so good as that which was\\r\\non the opposite side of the wall, and the plum-tree had forced its way\\r\\nthrough the wall, and gradually had taken possession of the ground which\\r\\nit liked best.\\r\\n\\r\\nOakly thought the plum-tree, as it belonged to Mr. Grant, had no right to\\r\\nmake its appearance on his ground:  an attorney told him that he might\\r\\noblige Grant to cut it down; but Mr. Grant refused to cut down his plum-\\r\\ntree at the attorney\\'s desire, and the attorney persuaded Oakly to go to\\r\\nlaw about the business, and the lawsuit went on for some months.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney, at the end of this time, came to Oakly with a demand for\\r\\nmoney to carry on his suit, assuring him that, in a short time, it would\\r\\nbe determined in his favour.  Oakly paid his attorney ten golden guineas,\\r\\nremarked that it was a great sum for him to pay, and that nothing but the\\r\\nlove of justice could make him persevere in this lawsuit about a bit of\\r\\nground, \"which, after all,\" said he, \"is not worth twopence.  The plum-\\r\\ntree does me little or no damage, but I don\\'t like to be imposed upon by\\r\\na Scotchman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney saw and took advantage of Oakly\\'s prejudice against the\\r\\nnatives of Scotland; and he persuaded him, that to show the SPIRIT of a\\r\\ntrue-born Englishman it was necessary, whatever it might cost him, to\\r\\npersist in this law suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was soon after this conversation with the attorney that Mr. Oakly\\r\\nwalked, with resolute steps, towards the plum-tree, saying to himself,\\r\\n\"If it cost me a hundred pounds I will not let this cunning Scotchman get\\r\\nthe better of me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur interrupted his father\\'s reverie, by pointing to a book and some\\r\\nyoung plants which lay upon the wall.  \"I fancy, father,\" said he, \"those\\r\\nthings are for you, for there is a little note directed to you, in\\r\\nMaurice\\'s handwriting.  Shall I bring it to you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, let me read it, child, since I must.\"  It contained these words:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR MR. OAKLY,--I don\\'t know why you have quarrelled with us; I am very\\r\\nsorry for it.  But though you are angry with me, I am not angry with you.\\r\\nI hope you will not refuse some of my Brobdingnag raspberry-plants, which\\r\\nyou asked for a great while ago, when we were all good friends.  It was\\r\\nnot the right time of the year to plant them, which was the reason they\\r\\nwere not sent to you; but it is just the right time to plant them now;\\r\\nand I send you the book, in which you will find the reason why we always\\r\\nput seaweed ashes about their roots; and I have got some seaweed ashes\\r\\nfor you.  You will find the ashes in the flower-pot upon the wall.  I\\r\\nhave never spoken to Arthur, nor he to me, since you bid us not.  So,\\r\\nwishing your Brobdingnag raspberries may turn out as well as ours, and\\r\\nlonging to be all friends again, I am, with love to dear Arthur and self,\\r\\n                     \"Your affectionate neighbour\\'s son,\\r\\n                                              \"MAURICE GRANT.\\r\\n\"P.S.--It is now about four months since the quarrel began, and that is a\\r\\nvery long while.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA great part of the effect of this letter was lost upon Oakly, because he\\r\\nwas not very expert in reading writing, and it cost him much trouble to\\r\\nspell it and put it together.  However, he seemed affected by it, and\\r\\nsaid, \"I believe this Maurice loves you well enough, Arthur, and he seems\\r\\na good sort of boy; but as to the raspberries, I believe all that he says\\r\\nabout them is but an excuse; and, at anyrate, as I could not get \\'em when\\r\\nI asked for them, I\\'ll not have \\'em now.  Do you hear me, I say, Arthur?\\r\\nWhat are you reading there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur was reading the page that was doubled down in the book, which\\r\\nMaurice had left along with the raspberry-plants upon the wall.  Arthur\\r\\nread aloud as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n               (Monthly Magazine, Dec. \\'98, p. 421.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a sort of strawberry cultivated at Jersey, which is almost\\r\\ncovered with seaweed in the winter, in like manner as many plants in\\r\\nEngland are with litter from the stable.  These strawberries are usually\\r\\nof the largeness of a middle-sized apricot, and the flavour is\\r\\nparticularly grateful.  In Jersey and Guernsey, situate scarcely one\\r\\ndegree farther south than Cornwall, all kinds of fruit, pulse, and\\r\\nvegetables are produced in their seasons a fortnight or three weeks\\r\\nsooner than in England, even on the southern shores; and snow will\\r\\nscarcely remain twenty-four hours on the earth.  Although this may be\\r\\nattributed to these islands being surrounded with a salt, and\\r\\nconsequently a moist atmosphere, yet the ashes (seaweed ashes) made use\\r\\nof as manure, may also have their portion of influence.\"*\\r\\n\\r\\n*It is necessary to observe that this experiment has never been actually\\r\\ntried upon raspberry-plants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And here,\" continued Arthur, \"is something written with a pencil, on a\\r\\nslip of paper, and it is Maurice\\'s writing.  I will read it to you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'When I read in this book what is said about the strawberries growing as\\r\\nlarge as apricots, after they had been covered over with seaweed, I\\r\\nthought that perhaps seaweed ashes might be good for my father\\'s\\r\\nraspberries; and I asked him if he would give me leave to try them.  He\\r\\ngave me leave, and I went directly and gathered together some seaweed\\r\\nthat had been cast on shore; and I dried it, and burned it, and then I\\r\\nmanured the raspberries with it, and the year afterwards the raspberries\\r\\ngrew to the size that you have seen.  Now, the reason I tell you this is,\\r\\nfirst, that you may know how to manage your raspberries, and next,\\r\\nbecause I remember you looked very grave, as if you were not pleased with\\r\\nmy father, Mr. Grant, when he told you that the way by which he came by\\r\\nhis Brobdingnag raspberries was a secret.  Perhaps this was the thing\\r\\nthat has made you so angry with us all; for you never have come to see\\r\\nfather since that evening.  Now I have told you all I know; and so I hope\\r\\nyou will not be angry with us any longer.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Oakly was much pleased by this openness, and said, \"Why now, Arthur,\\r\\nthis is something like, this is telling one the thing one wants to know,\\r\\nwithout fine speeches.  This is like an Englishman more than a Scotchman.\\r\\nPray, Arthur, do you know whether your friend Maurice was born in England\\r\\nor in Scotland?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, sir, I don\\'t know--I never asked--I did not think it\\r\\nsignified.  All I know is, that wherever he was born, he is VERY good.\\r\\nLook, papa, my tulip is blowing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" said his father, \"this will be a beautiful tulip!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was given to me by Maurice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And did you give him nothing for it?\" was the father\\'s inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing in the world; and he gave it to me just at the time when he had\\r\\ngood cause to be angry with me, just when I had broken his bell-glass.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a great mind to let you play together again,\" said Arthur\\'s\\r\\nfather.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, if you would,\" cried Arthur, clapping his hands, \"how happy we\\r\\nshould be!  Do you know, father, I have often sat for an hour at a time\\r\\nup in that crab-tree, looking at Maurice at work in his garden, and\\r\\nwishing that I was at work with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Arthur was interrupted by the attorney, who came to ask Mr. Oakly\\r\\nsome question about the lawsuit concerning the plum-tree.  Oakly showed\\r\\nhim Maurice\\'s letter; and to Arthur\\'s extreme astonishment, the attorney\\r\\nhad no sooner read it, than he exclaimed, \"What an artful little\\r\\ngentleman this is!  I never, in the course of all my practice, met with\\r\\nanything better.  Why, this is the most cunning letter I ever read.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where\\'s the cunning?\" said Oakly, and he put on his spectacles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My good sir, don\\'t you see, that all this stuff about Brobdingnag\\r\\nraspberries is to ward off your suit about the plum-tree?  They know--\\r\\nthat is, Mr. Grant, who is sharp enough, knows--that he will be worsted\\r\\nin that suit; that he must, in short, pay you a good round sum for\\r\\ndamages, if it goes on--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Damages!\" said Oakly, staring round him at the plum-tree; \"but I don\\'t\\r\\nknow what you mean.  I mean nothing but what\\'s honest.  I don\\'t mean to\\r\\nask for any good round sum; for the plum-tree has done me no great harm\\r\\nby coming into my garden; but only I don\\'t choose it should come there\\r\\nwithout my leave.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well,\" said the attorney, \"I understand all that; but what I want\\r\\nto make you, Mr. Oakly, understand, is, that this Grant and his son only\\r\\nwant to make up matters with you, and prevent the thing\\'s coming to a\\r\\nfair trial, by sending on, in this underhand sort of way, a bribe of a\\r\\nfew raspberries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A bribe!\" exclaimed Oakly, \"I never took a bribe, and I never will\";\\r\\nand, with sudden indignation, he pulled the raspberry plants from the\\r\\nground in which Arthur was planting them; and he threw them over the wall\\r\\ninto Grant\\'s garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaurice had put his tulip, which was beginning to blow, in a flower-pot,\\r\\non the top of the wall, in hopes that his friend Arthur would see it from\\r\\nday to day.  Alas! he knew not in what a dangerous situation he had\\r\\nplaced it.  One of his own Brobdingnag raspberry-plants, swung by the\\r\\nangry arm of Oakly, struck off the head of his precious tulip!  Arthur,\\r\\nwho was full of the thought of convincing his father that the attorney\\r\\nwas mistaken in his judgment of poor Maurice, did not observe the fall of\\r\\nthe tulip.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, when Maurice saw his raspberry-plants scattered upon the\\r\\nground, and his favourite tulip broken, he was in much astonishment, and,\\r\\nfor some moments, angry; but anger, with him, never lasted long.  He was\\r\\nconvinced that all this must be owing to some accident or mistake.  He\\r\\ncould not believe that anyone could be so malicious as to injure him on\\r\\npurpose--\"And even if they did all this on purpose to vex me,\" said he to\\r\\nhimself, \"the best thing I can do, is, not to let it vex me.  Forgive and\\r\\nforget.\"  This temper of mind Maurice was more happy in enjoying than he\\r\\ncould have been made, without it, by the possession of all the tulips in\\r\\nHolland.\\r\\n\\r\\nTulips were, at this time, things of great consequence in the estimation\\r\\nof the country several miles round where Maurice and Arthur lived.  There\\r\\nwas a florist\\'s feast to be held at the neighbouring town, at which a\\r\\nprize of a handsome set of gardening-tools was to be given to the person\\r\\nwho could produce the finest flower of its kind.  A tulip was the flower\\r\\nwhich was thought the finest the preceding year, and consequently numbers\\r\\nof people afterwards endeavoured to procure tulip-roots, in hopes of\\r\\nobtaining the prize this year.  Arthur\\'s tulip was beautiful.  As he\\r\\nexamined it from day to day, and every day thought it improving, he\\r\\nlonged to thank his friend Maurice for it; and he often mounted into his\\r\\ncrab-tree, to look into Maurice\\'s garden, in hopes of seeing his tulip\\r\\nalso in full bloom and beauty.  He never could see it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day of the florist\\'s feast arrived, and Oakly went with his son and\\r\\nthe fine tulip to the place of meeting.  It was on a spacious bowling-\\r\\ngreen.  All the flowers of various sorts were ranged upon a terrace at\\r\\nthe upper end of the bowling-green; and, amongst all this gay variety,\\r\\nthe tulip which Maurice had given to Arthur appeared conspicuously\\r\\nbeautiful.  To the owner of this tulip the prize was adjudged; and, as\\r\\nthe handsome garden-tools were delivered to Arthur, he heard a well known\\r\\nvoice wish him joy.  He turned, looked about him, and saw his friend\\r\\nMaurice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Maurice, where is your own tulip?\" said Mr. Oakly; \"I thought,\\r\\nArthur, you told me that he kept one for himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I did,\" said Maurice; \"but somebody (I suppose by accident) broke\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Somebody! who?\" cried Arthur and Mr. Oakly at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Somebody who threw the raspberry-plants back again over the wall,\"\\r\\nreplied Maurice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That was me--that somebody was me,\" said Oakly.  \"I scorn to deny it;\\r\\nbut I did not intend to break your tulip, Maurice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear Maurice,\" said Arthur--\"you know I may call him dear Maurice--now\\r\\nyou are by, papa; here are all the garden-tools; take them, and welcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not one of them,\" said Maurice, drawing back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Offer them to the father--offer them to Mr. Grant,\" whispered Oakly;\\r\\n\"he\\'ll take them, I\\'ll answer for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Oakly was mistaken:  the father would not accept of the tools.  Mr.\\r\\nOakly stood surprised--\"Certainly,\" said he to himself, \"this cannot be\\r\\nsuch a miser as I took him for\"; and he walked immediately up to Grant,\\r\\nand bluntly said to him, \"Mr. Grant, your son has behaved very handsomely\\r\\nto my son; and you seem to be glad of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure I am,\" said Grant\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which,\" continued Oakly, \"gives me a better opinion of you than ever I\\r\\nhad before--I mean, than ever I had since the day you sent me the shabby\\r\\nanswer about those foolish, what d\\'ye call em, cursed raspberries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What shabby answer?\" said Grant, with surprise; and Oakly repeated\\r\\nexactly the message which he received; and Grant declared that he never\\r\\nsent any such message.  He repeated exactly the answer which he really\\r\\nsent, and Oakly immediately stretched out his hand to him, saying \"I\\r\\nbelieve you:  no more need be said.  I\\'m only sorry I did not ask you\\r\\nabout this four months ago; and so I should have done if you had not been\\r\\na Scotchman.  Till now, I never rightly liked a Scotchman.  We may thank\\r\\nthis good little fellow,\" continued he, turning to Maurice, \"for our\\r\\ncoming at last to a right understanding.  There was no holding out\\r\\nagainst his good nature.  I\\'m sure, from the bottom of my heart, I\\'m\\r\\nsorry I broke his tulip.  Shake hands, boys; I\\'m glad to see you, Arthur,\\r\\nlook so happy again, and hope Mr. Grant will forgive--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, forgive and forget,\" said Grant and his son at the same moment.  And\\r\\nfrom this time forward the two families lived in friendship with each\\r\\nother.\\r\\n\\r\\nOakly laughed at his own folly, in having been persuaded to go to law\\r\\nabout the plum-tree; and he, in process of time, so completely conquered\\r\\nhis early prejudice against Scotchmen, that he and Grant became partners\\r\\nin business.  Mr. Grant\\'s book-LARNING and knowledge of arithmetic he\\r\\nfound highly useful to him; and he, on his side, possessed a great many\\r\\nactive, good qualities, which became serviceable to his partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two boys rejoiced in this family union; and Arthur often declared\\r\\nthat they owed all their happiness to Maurice\\'s favourite maxim, \"Forgive\\r\\nand Forget.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWASTE NOT, WANT NOT; or TWO STRINGS TO YOUR BOW.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gresham, a Bristol merchant, who had, by honourable industry and\\r\\neconomy, accumulated a considerable fortune, retired from business to a\\r\\nnew house which he had built upon the Downs, near Clifton.  Mr. Gresham,\\r\\nhowever, did not imagine that a new house alone could make him happy.  He\\r\\ndid not propose to live in idleness and extravagance; for such a life\\r\\nwould have been equally incompatible with his habits and his principles.\\r\\nHe was fond of children; and as he had no sons, he determined to adopt\\r\\none of his relations.  He had two nephews, and he invited both of them to\\r\\nhis house, that he might have an opportunity of judging of their\\r\\ndispositions, and of the habits which they had acquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nHal and Benjamin, Mr. Gresham\\'s nephews, were about ten years old.  They\\r\\nhad been educated very differently.  Hal was the son of the elder branch\\r\\nof the family.  His father was a gentleman, who spent rather more than he\\r\\ncould afford; and Hal, from the example of the servants in his father\\'s\\r\\nfamily, with whom he had passed the first years of his childhood, learned\\r\\nto waste more of everything than he used.  He had been told that\\r\\n\"gentlemen should be above being careful and saving\":  and he had\\r\\nunfortunately imbibed a notion that extravagance was the sign of a\\r\\ngenerous disposition, and economy of an avaricious one.\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin, on the contrary, had been taught habits of care and foresight.\\r\\nHis father had but a very small fortune, and was anxious that his son\\r\\nshould early learn that economy ensures independence, and sometimes puts\\r\\nit in the power of those who are not very rich to be very generous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning after these two boys arrived at their uncle\\'s they were eager\\r\\nto see all the rooms in the house.  Mr. Gresham accompanied them, and\\r\\nattended to their remarks and exclamations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! what an excellent motto!\" exclaimed Ben, when he read the following\\r\\nwords, which were written in large characters over the chimney-piece, in\\r\\nhis uncle\\'s spacious kitchen--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"WASTE NOT, WANT NOT.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Waste not, want not!\\'\" repeated his cousin Hal, in rather a\\r\\ncontemptuous tone; \"I think it looks stingy to servants; and no\\r\\ngentleman\\'s servants, cooks especially, would like to have such a mean\\r\\nmotto always staring them in the face.\"  Ben, who was not so conversant\\r\\nas his cousin in the ways of cooks and gentlemen\\'s servants, made no\\r\\nreply to these observations.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gresham was called away whilst his nephews were looking at the other\\r\\nrooms in the house.  Some time afterwards, he heard their voices in the\\r\\nhall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Boys,\" said he, \"what are you doing there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing, sir,\" said Hal; \"you were called away from us and we did not\\r\\nknow which way to go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have you nothing to do?\" said Mr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir, nothing,\" answered Hal, in a careless tone, like one who was\\r\\nwell content with the state of habitual idleness.  \"No, sir, nothing!\"\\r\\nreplied Ben, in a voice of lamentation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come,\" said Mr. Gresham, \"if you have nothing to do, lads, will you\\r\\nunpack those two parcels for me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two parcels were exactly alike, both of them well tied up with good\\r\\nwhip cord.  Ben took his parcel to a table, and, after breaking off the\\r\\nsealing wax, began carefully to examine the knot, and then to untie it.\\r\\nHal stood still, exactly in the spot where the parcel was put into his\\r\\nhands, and tried first at one corner, and then at another, to pull the\\r\\nstring off by force.  \"I wish these people wouldn\\'t tie up their parcels\\r\\nso tight, as if they were never to be undone,\" cried he, as he tugged at\\r\\nthe cord; and he pulled the knot closer instead of loosening it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ben! why, how did you get yours undone, man? what\\'s in your parcel?--I\\r\\nwonder what is in mine!  I wish I could get this string off--I must cut\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" said Ben, who now had undone the last knot of his parcel, and\\r\\nwho drew out the length of string with exultation, \"don\\'t cut it, Hal,--\\r\\nlook what a nice cord this is, and yours is the same:  it\\'s a pity to cut\\r\\nit; \\'WASTE NOT, WANT NOT!\\' you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pooh!\" said Hal, \"what signifies a bit of packthread?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is whip cord,\" said Ben.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, whip cord! what signifies a bit of whip cord! you can get a bit of\\r\\nwhip cord twice as long as that for twopence; and who cares for twopence!\\r\\nNot I, for one! so here it goes,\" cried Hal, drawing out his knife; and\\r\\nhe cut the cord, precipitately, in sundry places.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lads! have you undone the parcels for me?\" said Mr. Gresham, opening the\\r\\nparlour door as he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir,\" cried Hal; and he dragged off his half cut, half entangled\\r\\nstring--\"here\\'s the parcel.\"  \"And here\\'s my parcel, uncle; and here\\'s\\r\\nthe string,\" said Ben.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may keep the string for your pains,\" said Mr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Ben:  \"what an excellent whip cord it is!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you, Hal,\" continued Mr. Gresham, \"you may keep your string too, if\\r\\nit will be of any use to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will be of no use to me, thank you, sir,\" said Hal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I am afraid not, if this be it,\" said his uncle, taking up the\\r\\njagged knotted remains of Hal\\'s cord.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days after this, Mr. Gresham gave to each of his nephews a new top.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how\\'s this?\" said Hal; \"these tops have no strings; what shall we do\\r\\nfor strings?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a string that will do very well for mine,\" said Ben; and he\\r\\npulled out of his pocket the fine, long, smooth string, which had tied up\\r\\nthe parcel.  With this he soon set up his top, which spun admirably well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, how I wish I had but a string,\" said Hal.  \"What shall I do for a\\r\\nstring?  I\\'ll tell you what, I can use the string that goes round my\\r\\nhat!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But then,\" said Ben, \"what will you do for a hat-band?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll manage to do without one,\" said Hal, and he took the string of his\\r\\nhat for his top.  It soon was worn through, and he split his top by\\r\\ndriving the pea too tightly into it.  His cousin Ben let him set up his\\r\\nthe next day; but Hal was not more fortunate or more careful when he\\r\\nmeddled with other people\\'s things than when he managed his own.  He had\\r\\nscarcely played half an hour before he split it, by driving the peg too\\r\\nviolently.\\r\\n\\r\\nBen bore this misfortune with good humour.  \"Come,\" said he, \"it can\\'t be\\r\\nhelped; but give me the string because THAT may still be of use for\\r\\nsomething else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened some time afterwards that a lady, who had been intimately\\r\\nacquainted with Hal\\'s mother at Bath--that is to say, who had frequently\\r\\nmet her at the card-table during the winter--now arrived at Clifton.  She\\r\\nwas informed by his mother that Hal was at Mr. Gresham\\'s, and her sons,\\r\\nwho were FRIENDS of his, came to see him, and invited him to spend the\\r\\nnext day with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHal joyfully accepted the invitation.  He was always glad to go out to\\r\\ndine, because it gave him something to do, something to think of, or at\\r\\nleast something to say.  Besides this, he had been educated to think it\\r\\nwas a fine thing to visit fine people; and Lady Diana Sweepstakes (for\\r\\nthat was the name of his mother\\'s acquaintance) was a very fine lady, and\\r\\nher two sons intended to be very great gentlemen.  He was in a prodigious\\r\\nhurry when these young gentlemen knocked at his uncle\\'s door the next\\r\\nday; but just as he got to the hall door, little Patty called to him from\\r\\nthe top of the stairs, and told him that he had dropped his pocket-\\r\\nhandkerchief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pick it up, then, and bring it to me, quick, can\\'t you, child,\" cried\\r\\nHal, \"for Lady Di\\'s sons are waiting for me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Patty did not know anything about Lady Di\\'s sons; but as she was\\r\\nvery good-natured, and saw that her cousin Hal was, for some reason or\\r\\nother, in a desperate hurry, she ran downstairs as fast as she possibly\\r\\ncould towards the landing-place, where the handkerchief lay; but, alas!\\r\\nbefore she reached the handkerchief, she fell, rolling down a whole\\r\\nflight of stairs, and when her fall was at last stopped by the landing-\\r\\nplace, she did not cry out, she writhed, as if she was in great pain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where are you hurt, my love?\" said Mr. Gresham, who came instantly, on\\r\\nhearing the noise of someone falling downstairs.  \"Where are you hurt, my\\r\\ndear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here, papa,\" said the little girl, touching her ankle, which she had\\r\\ndecently covered with her gown.  \"I believe I am hurt here, but not\\r\\nmuch,\" added she, trying to rise; \"only it hurts me when I move.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll carry you; don\\'t move then,\" said her father, and he took her up in\\r\\nhis arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My shoe!  I\\'ve lost one of my shoes,\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\nBen looked for it upon the stairs, and he found it sticking in a loop of\\r\\nwhip cord, which was entangled round one of the bannisters.  When this\\r\\ncord was drawn forth, it appeared that it was the very same jagged,\\r\\nentangled piece which Hal had pulled off his parcel.  He had diverted\\r\\nhimself with running up and downstairs, whipping the bannisters with it,\\r\\nas he thought he could convert it to no better use; and, with his usual\\r\\ncarelessness, he at last left it hanging just where he happened to throw\\r\\nit when the dinner bell rang.  Poor little Patty\\'s ankle was terribly\\r\\nstrained, and Hal reproached himself for his folly, and would have\\r\\nreproached himself longer, perhaps, if Lady Di Sweepstakes\\' sons had not\\r\\nhurried him away.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening, Patty could not run about as she used to do; but she sat\\r\\nupon the sofa, and she said, that she did not feel the pain of her ankle\\r\\nSO MUCH, whilst Ben was so good as to play at JACK STRAWS with her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s right, Ben; never be ashamed of being good-natured to those who\\r\\nare younger and weaker than yourself,\" said his uncle, smiling at seeing\\r\\nhim produce his whip cord, to indulge his little cousin with a game at\\r\\nher favourite cat\\'s cradle.  \"I shall not think you one bit less manly,\\r\\nbecause I see you playing at cat\\'s cradle with a little child of six\\r\\nyears old.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHal, however, was not precisely of his uncle\\'s opinion:  for when he\\r\\nreturned in the evening, and saw Ben playing with his little cousin, he\\r\\ncould not help smiling contemptuously, and asked if he had been playing\\r\\nat cat\\'s cradle all night.  In a heedless manner he made some inquiries\\r\\nafter Patty\\'s sprained ankle, and then he ran on to tell all the news he\\r\\nhad heard at Lady Diana Sweepstakes\\'--news which he thought would make\\r\\nhim appear a person of vast importance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know, uncle--do you know, Ben,\" said he--\"there\\'s to be the most\\r\\nFAMOUS doings that ever were heard of upon the Downs here, the first day\\r\\nof next month, which will be in a fortnight, thank my stars!  I wish the\\r\\nfortnight was over; I shall think of nothing else, I know, till that\\r\\nhappy day comes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gresham inquired why the first of September was to be so much happier\\r\\nthan any other day in the year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" replied Hal, \"Lady Diana Sweepstakes, you know, is a famous rider,\\r\\nand archer, and ALL THAT--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very likely,\" said Mr. Gresham, soberly; \"but what then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear uncle!\" cried Hal, \"but you shall hear.  There\\'s to be a race upon\\r\\nthe Downs on the first of September, and after the race, there\\'s to be an\\r\\narchery meeting for the ladies, and Lady Diana Sweepstakes is to be one\\r\\nof THEM.  And after the ladies have done shooting--now, Ben, comes the\\r\\nbest part of it! we boys are to have our turn, and Lady Di is to give a\\r\\nprize to the best marksman amongst us, of a very handsome bow and arrow!\\r\\nDo you know, I\\'ve been practising already, and I\\'ll show you, to-morrow,\\r\\nas soon as it comes home, the FAMOUS bow and arrow that Lady Diana has\\r\\ngiven me; but, perhaps,\" added he, with a scornful laugh, \"you like a\\r\\ncat\\'s cradle better than a bow and arrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBen made no reply to this taunt at the moment; but the next day, when\\r\\nHal\\'s new bow and arrow came home, he convinced him that he knew how to\\r\\nuse it very well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ben,\" said his uncle, \"you seem to be a good marksman, though you have\\r\\nnot boasted of yourself.  I\\'ll give you a bow and arrow, and, perhaps, if\\r\\nyou practise, you may make yourself an archer before the first of\\r\\nSeptember; and, in the meantime, you will not wish the fortnight to be\\r\\nover, for you will have something to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, sir,\" interrupted Hal, \"but if you mean that Ben should put in for\\r\\nthe prize, he must have a uniform.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why MUST he?\" said Mr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, sir, because everybody has--I mean everybody that\\'s anybody; and\\r\\nLady Diana was talking about the uniform all dinner time, and it\\'s\\r\\nsettled, all about it, except the buttons:  the young Sweepstakes are to\\r\\nget theirs made first for patterns--they are to be white, faced with\\r\\ngreen, and they\\'ll look very handsome, I\\'m sure; and I shall write to\\r\\nmamma to-night, as Lady Diana bid me, about mine; and I shall tell her to\\r\\nbe sure to answer my letter, without fail, by return of post; and then,\\r\\nif mamma makes no objection, which I know she won\\'t, because she never\\r\\nthinks much about expense, and ALL THAT--then I shall bespeak my uniform,\\r\\nand get it made by the same tailor that makes for Lady Diana and the\\r\\nyoung Sweepstakes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mercy upon us!\" said Mr. Gresham, who was almost stunned by the rapid\\r\\nvociferation with which this long speech about a uniform was pronounced.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t pretend to understand these things,\" added he, with an air of\\r\\nsimplicity; \"but we will inquire, Ben, into the necessity of the case;\\r\\nand if it is necessary--or, if you think it necessary, that you shall\\r\\nhave a uniform--why, I\\'ll give you one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU, uncle?  Will you, INDEED?\" exclaimed Hal, with amazement painted in\\r\\nhis countenance.  \"Well, that\\'s the last thing in the world I should have\\r\\nexpected!  You are not at all the sort of person I should have thought\\r\\nwould care about a uniform; and now I should have supposed you\\'d have\\r\\nthought it extravagant to have a coat on purpose only for one day; and\\r\\nI\\'m sure Lady Diana Sweepstakes thought as I do; for when I told her of\\r\\nthat motto over your kitchen chimney, \\'WASTE NOT, WANT NOT,\\' she laughed,\\r\\nand said that I had better not talk to you about uniforms, and that my\\r\\nmother was the proper person to write to about my uniform:  but I\\'ll tell\\r\\nLady Diana, uncle, how good you are, and how much she was mistaken.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care how you do that,\" said Mr. Gresham:  \"for perhaps the lady was\\r\\nnot mistaken.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, did not you say, just now, you would give poor Ben a uniform?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I said I would, if he thought it necessary to have one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I\\'ll answer for it, he\\'ll think it necessary, \" said Hal, laughing,\\r\\n\"because it is necessary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Allow him, at least, to judge for himself,\" said Mr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear uncle, but I assure you,\" said Hal, earnestly, \"there\\'s no\\r\\njudging about the matter, because really, upon my word, Lady Diana said\\r\\ndistinctly, that her sons were to have uniforms, white faced with green,\\r\\nand a green and white cockade in their hats.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May be so,\" said Mr. Gresham, still with the same look of calm\\r\\nsimplicity; \"put on your hats, boys, and come with me.  I know a\\r\\ngentleman whose sons are to be at this archery meeting, and we will\\r\\ninquire into all the particulars from him.  Then, after we have seen him\\r\\n(it is not eleven o\\'clock yet) we shall have time enough to walk on to\\r\\nBristol, and choose the cloth for Ben\\'s uniform, if it is necessary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot tell what to make of all he says,\" whispered Hal, as he reached\\r\\ndown his hat; \"do you think, Ben, he means to give you this uniform, or\\r\\nnot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think,\" said Ben, \"that he means to give me one, if it is necessary;\\r\\nor, as he said, if I think it is necessary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that to be sure you will; won\\'t you? or else you\\'ll be a great fool,\\r\\nI know, after all I\\'ve told you.  How can anyone in the world know so\\r\\nmuch about the matter as I, who have dined with Lady Diana Sweepstakes\\r\\nbut yesterday, and heard all about it from beginning to end?  And as for\\r\\nthis gentleman that we are going to, I\\'m sure, if he knows anything about\\r\\nthe matter, he\\'ll say exactly the same as I do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall hear,\" said Ben, with a degree of composure which Hal could by\\r\\nno means comprehend when a uniform was in question.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentleman upon whom Mr. Gresham called had three sons, who were all\\r\\nto be at this archery meeting; and they unanimously assured him, in the\\r\\npresence of Hal and Ben, that they had never thought of buying uniforms\\r\\nfor this grand occasion, and that, amongst the number of their\\r\\nacquaintance, they knew of but three boys whose friends intended to be at\\r\\nsuch an UNNECESSARY expense.  Hal stood amazed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such are the varieties of opinion upon all the grand affairs of life,\"\\r\\nsaid Mr. Gresham, looking at his nephews.  \"What amongst one set of\\r\\npeople you hear asserted to be absolutely necessary, you will hear from\\r\\nanother set of people is quite unnecessary.  All that can be done, my\\r\\ndear boys, in these difficult cases, is to judge for yourselves, which\\r\\nopinions, and which people, are the most reasonable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHal, who had been more accustomed to think of what was fashionable, than\\r\\nof what was reasonable, without at all considering the good sense of what\\r\\nhis uncle said to him, replied, with childish petulance, \"Indeed, sir, I\\r\\ndon\\'t know what other people think; but I only know what Lady Diana\\r\\nSweepstakes said.\"  The name of Lady Diana Sweepstakes, Hal thought, must\\r\\nimpress all present with respect; he was highly astonished, when, as he\\r\\nlooked round, he saw a smile of contempt upon everyone\\'s countenance:\\r\\nand he was yet further bewildered, when he heard her spoken of as a very\\r\\nsilly, extravagant, ridiculous woman, whose opinion no prudent person\\r\\nwould ask upon any subject, and whose example was to be shunned, instead\\r\\nof being imitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, my dear Hal,\" said his uncle, smiling at his look of amazement,\\r\\n\"these are some of the things that young people must learn from\\r\\nexperience.  All the world do not agree in opinion about characters:  you\\r\\nwill hear the same person admired in one company, and blamed in another;\\r\\nso that we must still come round to the same point, \\'Judge for\\r\\nyourself.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHal\\'s thoughts were, however, at present too full of the uniform to allow\\r\\nhis judgment to act with perfect impartiality.  As soon as their visit\\r\\nwas over, and all the time they walked down the hill from Prince\\'s\\r\\nBuilding\\'s towards Bristol, he continued to repeat nearly the same\\r\\narguments, which he had formerly used, respecting necessity, the uniform,\\r\\nand Lady Diana Sweepstakes.  To all this Mr. Gresham made no reply, and\\r\\nlonger had the young gentleman expatiated upon the subject, which had so\\r\\nstrongly seized upon his imagination, had not his senses been forcibly\\r\\nassailed at this instant by the delicious odours and tempting sight of\\r\\ncertain cakes and jellies in a pastrycook\\'s shop.  \"Oh, uncle,\" said he,\\r\\nas his uncle was going to turn the corner to pursue the road to Bristol,\\r\\n\"look at those jellies!\" pointing to a confectioner\\'s shop.  \"I must buy\\r\\nsome of those good things, for I have got some halfpence in my pocket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your having halfpence in your pocket is an excellent reason for eating,\"\\r\\nsaid Mr. Gresham, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I really am hungry,\" said Hal; \"you know, uncle, it is a good while\\r\\nsince breakfast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis uncle, who was desirous to see his nephews act without restraint,\\r\\nthat he might judge their characters, bid them do as they pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, then, Ben, if you\\'ve any halfpence in your pocket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m not hungry,\" said Ben.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose THAT means that you\\'ve no halfpence,\" said Hal, laughing, with\\r\\nthe look of superiority which he had been taught to think the RICH might\\r\\nassume towards those who were convicted either of poverty or economy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Waste not, want not,\" said Ben to himself.  Contrary to his cousin\\'s\\r\\nsurmise, he happened to have two pennyworth of halfpence actually in his\\r\\npocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the very moment Hal stepped into the pastrycook\\'s shop, a poor,\\r\\nindustrious man, with a wooden leg, who usually sweeps the dirty corner\\r\\nof the walk which turns at this spot to the Wells, held his hat to Ben,\\r\\nwho, after glancing his eye at the petitioner\\'s well worn broom,\\r\\ninstantly produced his twopence.  \"I wish I had more halfpence for you,\\r\\nmy good man,\" said he; \"but I\\'ve only twopence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHal came out of Mr. Millar\\'s, the confectioner\\'s shop, with a hatful of\\r\\ncakes in his hand.  Mr. Millar\\'s dog was sitting on the flags before the\\r\\ndoor, and he looked up with a wistful, begging eye at Hal, who was eating\\r\\na queen cake.  Hal, who was wasteful even in his good-nature, threw a\\r\\nwhole queen cake to the dog, who swallowed it for a single mouthful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There goes twopence in the form of a queen cake,\" said Mr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\nHal next offered some of his cakes to his uncle and cousin; but they\\r\\nthanked him, and refused to eat any, because, they said, they were not\\r\\nhungry; so he ate and ate as he walked along, till at last he stopped,\\r\\nand said, \"This bun tastes so bad after the queen cakes, I can\\'t bear\\r\\nit!\" and he was going to fling it from him into the river.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, it is a pity to waste that good bun; we may be glad of it yet,\" said\\r\\nBen; \"give it me rather than throw it away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I thought you said you were not hungry,\" said Hal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True, I am not hungry now; but that is no reason why I should never be\\r\\nhungry again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, there is the cake for you.  Take it; for it has made me sick, and\\r\\nI don\\'t care what becomes of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBen folded the refuse bit of his cousin\\'s bun in a piece of paper, and\\r\\nput it into his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m beginning to be exceeding tired or sick or something,\" said Hal;\\r\\n\"and as there is a stand of coaches somewhere hereabouts, had not we\\r\\nbetter take a coach, instead of walking all the way to Bristol?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For a stout archer,\" said Mr. Gresham, \"you are more easily tired than\\r\\none might have expected.  However, with all my heart, let us take a\\r\\ncoach, for Ben asked me to show him the cathedral yesterday; and I\\r\\nbelieve I should find it rather too much for me to walk so far, though I\\r\\nam not sick with eating good things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THE CATHEDRAL!\" said Hal, after he had been seated in the coach about a\\r\\nquarter of an hour, and had somewhat recovered from his sickness--\"the\\r\\ncathedral!  Why, are we only going to Bristol to see the cathedral?  I\\r\\nthought we came out to see about a uniform.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a dulness and melancholy kind of stupidity in Hal\\'s countenance\\r\\nas he pronounced these words, like one wakening from a dream, which made\\r\\nboth his uncle and his cousin burst out a-laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" said Hal, who was now piqued, \"I\\'m sure you did say, uncle, you\\r\\nwould go to Mr. Hall\\'s to choose the cloth for the uniform.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true, and so I will,\" said Mr. Gresham; \"but we need not make a\\r\\nwhole morning\\'s work, need we, of looking at a piece of cloth?  Cannot we\\r\\nsee a uniform and a cathedral both in one morning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went first to the cathedral.  Hal\\'s head was too full of the uniform\\r\\nto take any notice of the painted window, which immediately caught Ben\\'s\\r\\nembarrassed attention.  He looked at the large stained figures on the\\r\\nGothic window, and he observed their coloured shadows on the floor and\\r\\nwalls.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gresham, who perceived that he was eager on all subjects to gain\\r\\ninformation, took this opportunity of telling him several things about\\r\\nthe lost art of painting on glass, Gothic arches, etc., which Hal thought\\r\\nextremely tiresome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come! come! we shall be late indeed,\" said Hal; \"surely you\\'ve looked\\r\\nlong enough, Ben, at this blue and red window.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m only thinking about these coloured shadows,\" said Ben.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can show you when we go home, Ben,\" said his uncle, \"an entertaining\\r\\npaper upon such shadows.\"*\\r\\n\\r\\n*Vide \"Priestley\\'s History of Vision,\" chapter on coloured shadows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hark!\" cried Ben, \"did you hear that noise?\"  They all listened; and\\r\\nthey heard a bird singing in the cathedral.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s our old robin, sir,\" said the lad who had opened the cathedral door\\r\\nfor them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Gresham, \"there he is, boys--look--perched upon the\\r\\norgan; he often sits there, and sings, whilst the organ is playing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And,\" continued the lad who showed the cathedral, \"he has lived here\\r\\nthese many, many winters.  They say he is fifteen years old; and he is so\\r\\ntame, poor fellow! that if I had a bit of bread he\\'d come down and feed\\r\\nin my hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve a bit of bun here,\" cried Ben, joyfully, producing the remains of\\r\\nthe bun which Hal but an hour before would have thrown away.  \"Pray, let\\r\\nus see the poor robin eat out of your hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lad crumbled the bun, and called to the robin, who fluttered and\\r\\nchirped, and seemed rejoiced at the sight of the bread; but yet he did\\r\\nnot come down from his pinnacle on the organ.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is afraid of US,\" said Ben; \"he is not used to eat before strangers,\\r\\nI suppose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, no, sir,\" said the young man, with a deep sigh, \"that is not the\\r\\nthing.  He is used enough to eat afore company.  Time was he\\'d have come\\r\\ndown for me before ever so many fine folks, and have eat his crumbs out\\r\\nof my hand, at my first call; but, poor fellow! it\\'s not his fault now.\\r\\nHe does not know me now, sir, since my accident, because of this great\\r\\nblack patch.\"  The young man put his hand to his right eye, which was\\r\\ncovered with a huge black patch.  Ben asked what ACCIDENT he meant; and\\r\\nthe lad told him that, but a few weeks ago, he had lost the sight of his\\r\\neye by the stroke of a stone, which reached him as he was passing under\\r\\nthe rocks at Clifton unluckily when the workmen were blasting.  \"I don\\'t\\r\\nmind so much for myself, sir,\" said the lad; \"but I can\\'t work so well\\r\\nnow, as I used to do before my accident, for my old mother, who has had a\\r\\nSTROKE of the palsy; and I\\'ve a many little brothers and sisters not well\\r\\nable yet to get their own livelihood, though they be as willing as\\r\\nwilling can be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where does your mother live?\" said Mr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hard by, sir, just close to the church here:  it was HER that always had\\r\\nthe showing of it to strangers, till she lost the use of her poor limbs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall we, may we, uncle, go that way?  This is the house; is not it?\"\\r\\nsaid Ben, when they went out of the cathedral.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went into the house; it was rather a hovel than a house; but, poor\\r\\nas it was, it was as neat as misery could make it.  The old woman was\\r\\nsitting up in her wretched bed, winding worsted; four meagre, ill-\\r\\nclothed, pale children were all busy, some of them sticking pins in paper\\r\\nfor the pin-maker, and others sorting rags for the paper-maker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a horrid place it is!\" said Hal, sighing; \"I did not know there\\r\\nwere such shocking places in the world.  I\\'ve often seen terrible-\\r\\nlooking, tumble-down places, as we drove through the town in mamma\\'s\\r\\ncarriage; but then I did not know who lived in them; and I never saw the\\r\\ninside of any of them.  It is very dreadful, indeed, to think that people\\r\\nare forced to live in this way.  I wish mamma would send me some more\\r\\npocket-money, that I might do something for them.  I had half a crown;\\r\\nbut,\" continued he, feeling in his pockets, \"I\\'m afraid I spent the last\\r\\nshilling of it this morning upon those cakes that made me sick.  I wish I\\r\\nhad my shilling now, I\\'d give it to these poor people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBen, though he was all this time silent, was as sorry as his talkative\\r\\ncousin for all these poor people.  But there was some difference between\\r\\nthe sorrow of these two boys.\\r\\n\\r\\nHal, after he was again seated in the hackney-coach, and had rattled\\r\\nthrough the busy streets of Bristol, for a few minutes quite forgot the\\r\\nspectacle of misery which he had seen; and the gay shops in Wine Street\\r\\nand the idea of his green and white uniform wholly occupied his\\r\\nimagination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now for our uniforms!\" cried he, as he jumped eagerly out of the coach,\\r\\nwhen his uncle stopped at the woollen-draper\\'s door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Uncle,\" said Ben, stopping Mr. Gresham before he got out of the\\r\\ncarriage, \"I don\\'t think a uniform is at all necessary for me.  I\\'m very\\r\\nmuch obliged to you; but I would rather not have one.  I have a very good\\r\\ncoat, and I think it would be waste.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, let me get out of the carriage, and we will see about it,\" said\\r\\nMr. Gresham; \"perhaps the sight of the beautiful green and white cloth,\\r\\nand the epaulettes (have you ever considered the epaulettes?) may tempt\\r\\nyou to change your mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" said Ben, laughing; \"I shall not change my mind,\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe green cloth, and the white cloth, and the epaulettes were produced,\\r\\nto Hal\\'s infinite satisfaction.  His uncle took up a pen, and calculated\\r\\nfor a few minutes; then, showing the back of the letter, upon which he\\r\\nwas writing, to his nephews, \"Cast up these sums, boys,\" said he, \"and\\r\\ntell me whether I am right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ben, do you do it,\" said Hal, a little embarrassed; \"I am not quick at\\r\\nfigures.\"  Ben WAS, and he went over his uncle\\'s calculation very\\r\\nexpeditiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is right, is it?\" said Mr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, quite right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, by this calculation, I find I could, for less than half the money\\r\\nyour uniforms would cost, purchase for each of you boys a warm great-\\r\\ncoat, which you will want, I have a notion, this winter upon the Downs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, sir,\" said Hal, with an alarmed look; \"but it is not winter YET; it\\r\\nis not cold weather YET.  We sha\\'n\\'t want greatcoats YET.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you remember how cold we were, Hal, the day before yesterday, in\\r\\nthat sharp wind, when we were flying our kite upon the Downs? and winter\\r\\nwill come, though it is not come yet--I am sure, I should like to have a\\r\\ngood warm great-coat very much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gresham took six guineas out of his purse and he placed three of them\\r\\nbefore Hal, and three before Ben.  \"Young gentlemen,\" said he, \"I believe\\r\\nyour uniforms would come to about three guineas a piece.  Now I will lay\\r\\nout this money for you just as you please.  Hal, what say you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, sir,\" said Hal, \"a great-coat is a good thing, to be sure; and\\r\\nthen, after the great-coat, as you said it would only cost half as much\\r\\nas the uniform, there would be some money to spare, would not there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, my dear, about five-and-twenty shillings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Five-and-twenty shillings?--I could buy and do a great many things, to\\r\\nbe sure, with five-and-twenty shillings; but then, THE THING IS, I must\\r\\ngo without the uniform, if I have the great-coat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" said his uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said Hal, sighing, as he looked at the epaulettes, \"uncle, if you\\r\\nwould not be displeased, if I choose the uniform--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall not be displeased at your choosing whatever you like best,\" said\\r\\nMr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, thank you, sir,\" said Hal; \"I think I had better have the\\r\\nuniform, because, if I have not the uniform, now, directly, it will be of\\r\\nno use to me, as the archery meeting is the week after next, you know;\\r\\nand, as to the great-coat, perhaps between this time and the VERY cold\\r\\nweather, which, perhaps, won\\'t be till Christmas, papa will buy a great-\\r\\ncoat for me; and I\\'ll ask mamma to give me some pocket money to give\\r\\naway, and she will, perhaps.\"  To all this conclusive, conditional\\r\\nreasoning, which depended upon the word PERHAPS, three times repeated,\\r\\nMr. Gresham made no reply; but he immediately bought the uniform for Hal,\\r\\nand desired that it should be sent to Lady Diana Sweepstakes\\' son\\'s\\r\\ntailor, to be made up.  The measure of Hal\\'s happiness was now complete.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how am I to lay out the three guineas for you, Ben?\" said Mr.\\r\\nGresham; \"speak, what do you wish for first?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great-coat, uncle, if you please.\"  Gresham bought the coat; and,\\r\\nafter it was paid for, five-and-twenty shillings of Ben\\'s three guineas\\r\\nremained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What next, my boy?\" said his uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Arrows, uncle, if you please; three arrows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, I promised you a bow and arrows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, uncle, you only said a bow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I meant a bow and arrows.  I\\'m glad you are so exact, however.  It\\r\\nis better to claim less than more than what is promised.  The three\\r\\narrows you shall have.  But go on; how shall I dispose of these five-and-\\r\\ntwenty shillings for you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In clothes, if you will be so good, uncle, for that poor boy who has the\\r\\ngreat black patch on his eye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I always believed,\" said Mr. Gresham, shaking hands with Ben, \"that\\r\\neconomy and generosity were the best friends, instead of being enemies,\\r\\nas some silly, extravagant people would have us think them.  Choose the\\r\\npoor, blind boy\\'s coat, my dear nephew, and pay for it.  There\\'s no\\r\\noccasion for my praising you about the matter.  Your best reward is in\\r\\nyour own mind, child; and you want no other, or I\\'m mistaken.  Now, jump\\r\\ninto the coach, boys, and let\\'s be off.  We shall be late, I\\'m afraid,\"\\r\\ncontinued he, as the coach drove on:  \"but I must let you stop, Ben, with\\r\\nyour goods, at the poor boy\\'s door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to the house, Mr. Gresham opened the coach door, and Ben\\r\\njumped out with his parcel under his arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stay, stay! you must take me with you,\" said his pleased uncle; \"I like\\r\\nto see people made happy, as well as you do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so do I, too,\" said Hal; \"let me come with you.  I almost wish my\\r\\nuniform was not gone to the tailor\\'s, so I do.\"  And when he saw the look\\r\\nof delight and gratitude with which the poor boy received the clothes\\r\\nwhich Ben gave him; and when he heard the mother and children thank him,\\r\\nhe sighed, and said, \"Well, I hope mamma will give me some more pocket\\r\\nmoney soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon his return home, however, the sight of the FAMOUS bow and arrow,\\r\\nwhich Lady Diana Sweepstakes had sent him, recalled to his imagination\\r\\nall the joys of his green and white uniform; and he no longer wished that\\r\\nit had not been sent to the tailor\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t understand, Cousin Hal,\" said little Patty, \"why you call\\r\\nthis bow a FAMOUS bow.  You say famous very often; and I don\\'t know\\r\\nexactly what it means; a famous uniform--famous doings.  I remember you\\r\\nsaid there are to be famous doings, the first of September, upon the\\r\\nDowns.  What does famous mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, why, famous means--now, don\\'t you know what famous means?  It means-\\r\\n-it is a word that people say--it is the fashion to say it--it means--it\\r\\nmeans famous.\"  Patty laughed, and said, \"This does not explain it to\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Hal, \"nor can it be explained:  if you don\\'t understand it,\\r\\nthat\\'s not my fault.  Everybody but little children, I suppose,\\r\\nunderstands it; but there\\'s no explaining THOSE SORT of words, if you\\r\\ndon\\'t TAKE THEM at once.  There\\'s to be famous doings upon the Downs, the\\r\\nfirst of September; that is grand, fine.  In short, what does it signify\\r\\ntalking any longer, Patty, about the matter?  Give me my bow, for I must\\r\\ngo out upon the Downs and practise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBen accompanied him with the bow and the three arrows which his uncle had\\r\\nnow given to him; and, every day, these two boys went out upon the Downs\\r\\nand practised shooting with indefatigable perseverance.  Where equal\\r\\npains are taken, success is usually found to be pretty nearly equal.  Our\\r\\ntwo archers, by constant practice, became expert marksmen; and before the\\r\\nday of trial, they were so exactly matched in point of dexterity, that it\\r\\nwas scarcely possible to decide which was superior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long expected lst of September at length arrived.  \"What sort of a\\r\\nday is it?\" was the first question that was asked by Hal and Ben the\\r\\nmoment that they wakened.  The sun shone bright, but there was a sharp\\r\\nand high wind.  \"Ha!\" said Ben, \"I shall be glad of my good great-coat\\r\\nto-day; for I\\'ve a notion it will be rather cold upon the Downs,\\r\\nespecially when we are standing still, as we must, whilst all the people\\r\\nare shooting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, never mind!  I don\\'t think I shall feel it cold at all,\" said Hal,\\r\\nas he dressed himself in his new green and white uniform; and he viewed\\r\\nhimself with much complacency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good morning to you, uncle; how do you do?\" said he, in a voice of\\r\\nexultation, when he entered the breakfast-room.  How do you do? seemed\\r\\nrather to mean, \"How do you like me in my uniform?\"  And his uncle\\'s\\r\\ncool, \"Very well, I thank you, Hal,\" disappointed him, as it seemed only\\r\\nto say, \"Your uniform makes no difference in my opinion of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEven little Patty went on eating her breakfast much as usual, and talked\\r\\nof the pleasure of walking with her father to the Downs, and of all the\\r\\nlittle things which interested her; so that Hal\\'s epaulettes were not the\\r\\nprincipal object in anyone\\'s imagination but his own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Papa,\" said Patty, \"as we go up the hill where there is so much red mud,\\r\\nI must take care to pick my way nicely; and I must hold up my frock, as\\r\\nyou desired me, and, perhaps, you will be so good, if I am not\\r\\ntroublesome, to lift me over the very bad place where are no stepping-\\r\\nstones.  My ankle is entirely well, and I\\'m glad of that, or else I\\r\\nshould not be able to walk so far as the Downs.  How good you were to me,\\r\\nBen, when I was in pain the day I sprained my ankle!  You played at jack\\r\\nstraws and at cat\\'s-cradle with me.  Oh, that puts me in mind--here are\\r\\nyour gloves which I asked you that night to let me mend.  I\\'ve been a\\r\\ngreat while about them; but are not they not very neatly mended, papa?\\r\\nLook at the sewing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not a very good judge of sewing, my dear little girl,\" said Mr.\\r\\nGresham, examining the work with a close and scrupulous eye; \"but, in my\\r\\nopinion, here is one stitch that is rather too long.  The white teeth are\\r\\nnot quite even.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, papa, I\\'ll take out that long tooth in a minute,\" said Patty,\\r\\nlaughing; \"I did not think that you would observe it so soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not have you trust to my blindness,\" said her father, stroking\\r\\nher head, fondly; \"I observe everything.  I observe, for instance, that\\r\\nyou are a grateful little girl, and that you are glad to be of use to\\r\\nthose who have been kind to you; and for this I forgive you the long\\r\\nstitch.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it\\'s out, it\\'s out, papa,\" said Patty; \"and the next time your\\r\\ngloves want mending, Ben, I\\'ll mend them better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are very nice, I think,\" said Ben, drawing them on; \"and I am much\\r\\nobliged to you.  I was just wishing I had a pair of gloves to keep my\\r\\nfingers warm to-day, for I never can shoot well when my hands are\\r\\nbenumbed.  Look, Hal; you know how ragged these gloves were; you said\\r\\nthey were good for nothing but to throw away; now look, there\\'s not a\\r\\nhole in them,\" said he, spreading his fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, is it not very extraordinary,\" said Hal to himself, \"that they\\r\\nshould go on so long talking about an old pair of gloves, without saying\\r\\nscarcely a word about my new uniform?  Well, the young Sweepstakes and\\r\\nLady Diana will talk enough about it; that\\'s one comfort.  Is not it time\\r\\nto think of setting out, sir?\" said Hal to his uncle.  \"The company, you\\r\\nknow, are to meet at the Ostrich at twelve, and the race to begin at one,\\r\\nand Lady Diana\\'s horses, I know were ordered to be at the door at ten.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Stephen, the butler, here interrupted the hurrying young gentleman in\\r\\nhis calculations.  \"There\\'s a poor lad, sir, below, with a great black\\r\\npatch on his right eye, who is come from Bristol, and wants to speak a\\r\\nword with the young gentlemen, if you please.  I told him they were just\\r\\ngoing out with you; but he says he won\\'t detain them more than half a\\r\\nminute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Show him up, show him up,\" said Mr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, I suppose,\" said Hal, with a sigh, \"that Stephen mistook, when he\\r\\nsaid the young GENTLEMEN; he only wants to see Ben, I daresay; I\\'m sure\\r\\nhe has no reason to want to see me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here he comes--Oh, Ben, he is dressed in the new coat you gave him,\"\\r\\nwhispered Hal, who was really a good-natured boy, though extravagant.\\r\\n\"How much better he looks than he did in the ragged coat!  Ah! he looked\\r\\nat you first, Ben--and well he may!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy bowed, without any cringing servility, but with an open, decent\\r\\nfreedom in his manner, which expressed that he had been obliged, but that\\r\\nhe knew his young benefactor was not thinking of the obligation.  He made\\r\\nas little distinction as possible between his bows to the two cousins.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I was sent with a message, by the clerk of our parish, to Redland\\r\\nchapel out on the Downs, to-day, sir,\" said he to Mr. Gresham, \"knowing\\r\\nyour house lay in my way, my mother, sir, bid me call, and make bold to\\r\\noffer the young gentlemen two little worsted balls that she has worked\\r\\nfor them,\" continued the lad, pulling out of his pocket two worsted balls\\r\\nworked in green and orange-coloured stripes.  \"They are but poor things,\\r\\nsir, she bid me say, to look at; but, considering she has but one hand to\\r\\nwork with, and that her left hand, you\\'ll not despise \\'em, we hopes.\"  He\\r\\nheld the balls to Ben and Hal.  \"They are both alike, gentlemen,\" said\\r\\nhe.  \"If you\\'ll be pleased to take \\'em they\\'re better than they look, for\\r\\nthey bound higher than your head.  I cut the cork round for the inside\\r\\nmyself, which was all I could do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are nice balls, indeed:  we are much obliged to you,\" said the boys\\r\\nas they received them, and they proved them immediately.  The balls\\r\\nstruck the floor with a delightful sound, and rebounded higher than Mr.\\r\\nGresham\\'s head.  Little Patty clapped her hands joyfully.  But now a\\r\\nthundering double rap at the door was heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Master Sweepstakes, sir,\" said Stephen, \"are come for Master Hal.\\r\\nThey say that all the young gentlemen who have archery uniforms are to\\r\\nwalk together, in a body, I think they say, sir; and they are to parade\\r\\nalong the Well Walk, they desired me to say, sir, with a drum and fife,\\r\\nand so up the hill by Prince\\'s Place, and all to go upon the Downs\\r\\ntogether, to the place of meeting.  I am not sure I\\'m right, sir; for\\r\\nboth the young gentlemen spoke at once, and the wind is very high at the\\r\\nstreet door; so that I could not well make out all they said; but I\\r\\nbelieve this is the sense of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Hal, eagerly, \"it\\'s all right.  I know that is just what\\r\\nwas settled the day I dined at Lady Diana\\'s; and Lady Diana and a great\\r\\nparty of gentlemen are to ride--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, that is nothing to the purpose,\" interrupted Mr. Gresham.  \"Don\\'t\\r\\nkeep these Master Sweepstakes waiting.  Decide--do you choose to go with\\r\\nthem or with us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir--uncle--sir, you know, since all the UNIFORMS agreed to go together-\\r\\n-\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Off with you, then, Mr. Uniform, if you mean to go,\" said Mr. Gresham.\\r\\n\\r\\nHal ran downstairs in such a hurry that he forgot his bow and arrows.\\r\\nBen discovered this when he went to fetch his own; and the lad from\\r\\nBristol, who had been ordered by Mr. Gresham to eat his breakfast before\\r\\nhe proceeded to Redland Chapel, heard Ben talking about his cousin\\'s bow\\r\\nand arrows.  \"I know,\" said Ben, \"he will be sorry not to have his bow\\r\\nwith him, because here are the green knots tied to it, to match his\\r\\ncockade:  and he said that the boys were all to carry their bows, as part\\r\\nof the show.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you\\'ll give me leave, sir,\" said the poor Bristol lad, \"I shall have\\r\\nplenty of time; and I\\'ll run down to the Well Walk after the young\\r\\ngentleman, and take him his bow and arrows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you?  I shall be much obliged to you,\" said Ben; and away went the\\r\\nboy with the bow that was ornamented with green ribands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe public walk leading to the Wells was full of company.  The windows of\\r\\nall the houses in St. Vincent\\'s Parade were crowded with well dressed\\r\\nladies, who were looking out in expectation of the archery procession.\\r\\nParties of gentlemen and ladies, and a motley crowd of spectators, were\\r\\nseen moving backwards and forwards, under the rocks, on the opposite side\\r\\nof the water.  A barge, with coloured streamers flying, was waiting to\\r\\ntake up a party who were going upon the water.  The bargemen rested upon\\r\\ntheir oars, and gazed with broad faces of curiosity upon the busy scene\\r\\nthat appeared upon the public walk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe archers and archeresses were now drawn up on the flags under the\\r\\nsemicircular piazza just before Mrs. Yearsley\\'s library.  A little band\\r\\nof children, who had been mustered by Lady Diana Sweepstakes\\' SPIRITED\\r\\nEXERTIONS, closed the procession.  They were now all in readiness.  The\\r\\ndrummer only waited for her ladyship\\'s signal; and the archers\\' corps\\r\\nonly waited for her ladyship\\'s word of command to march.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where are your bow and arrows, my little man?\" said her ladyship to Hal,\\r\\nas she reviewed her Lilliputian regiment.  \"You can\\'t march, man, without\\r\\nyour arms?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHal had despatched a messenger for his forgotten bow, but the messenger\\r\\nreturned not.  He looked from side to side in great distress--\"Oh,\\r\\nthere\\'s my bow coming, I declare!\" cried he; \"look, I see the bow and the\\r\\nribands.  Look now, between the trees, Charles Sweepstakes, on the\\r\\nHotwell Walk; it is coming!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you\\'ve kept us all waiting a confounded time,\" said his impatient\\r\\nfriend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is that good-natured poor fellow from Bristol, I protest, that has\\r\\nbrought it me; I\\'m sure I don\\'t deserve it from him,\" said Hal, to\\r\\nhimself, when he saw the lad with the black patch on his eye running,\\r\\nquite out of breath, towards him, with his bow and arrows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fall back, my good friend--fall back,\" said the military lady, as soon\\r\\nas he had delivered the bow to Hal; \"I mean, stand out of the way, for\\r\\nyour great patch cuts no figure amongst us.  Don\\'t follow so close, now,\\r\\nas if you belonged to us, pray.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor boy had no ambition to partake the triumph; he FELL BACK as soon\\r\\nas he understood the meaning of the lady\\'s words.  The drum beat, the\\r\\nfife played, the archers marched, the spectators admired.  Hal stepped\\r\\nproudly, and felt as if the eyes of the whole universe were upon his\\r\\nepaulettes, or upon the facings of his uniform; whilst all the time he\\r\\nwas considered only as part of a show.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe walk appeared much shorter than usual, and he was extremely sorry\\r\\nthat Lady Diana, when they were half-way up the hill leading to Prince\\'s\\r\\nPlace, mounted her horse, because the road was dirty, and all the\\r\\ngentlemen and ladies who accompanied her followed her example.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We can leave the children to walk, you know,\" said she to the gentleman\\r\\nwho helped her to mount her horse.  \"I must call to some of them, though,\\r\\nand leave orders where they are to join.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe beckoned:  and Hal, who was foremost, and proud to show his alacrity,\\r\\nran on to receive her ladyship\\'s orders.  Now, as we have before\\r\\nobserved, it was a sharp and windy day; and though Lady Diana Sweepstakes\\r\\nwas actually speaking to him, and looking at him, he could not prevent\\r\\nhis nose from wanting to be blowed:  he pulled out his handkerchief and\\r\\nout rolled the new ball which had been given to him just before he left\\r\\nhome, and which, according to his usual careless habits, he had stuffed\\r\\ninto his pockets in his hurry.  \"Oh, my new ball!\" cried he, as he ran\\r\\nafter it.  As he stopped to pick it up, he let go his hat, which he had\\r\\nhitherto held on with anxious care; for the hat, though it had a fine\\r\\ngreen and white cockade, had no band or string round it.  The string, as\\r\\nwe may recollect, our wasteful hero had used in spinning his top.  The\\r\\nhat was too large for his head without this band; a sudden gust of wind\\r\\nblew it off.  Lady Diana\\'s horse started and reared.  She was a FAMOUS\\r\\nhorse woman, and sat him to the admiration of all beholders; but there\\r\\nwas a puddle of red clay and water in this spot, and her ladyship\\'s\\r\\nuniform habit was a sufferer by the accident.  \"Careless brat!\" said she,\\r\\n\"why can\\'t he keep his hat upon his head?\"  In the meantime, the wind\\r\\nblew the hat down the hill, and Hal ran after it amidst the laughter of\\r\\nhis kind friends, the young Sweepstakes, and the rest of the little\\r\\nregiment.  The hat was lodged, at length, upon a bank.  Hal pursued it:\\r\\nhe thought this bank was hard, but, alas! the moment he set his foot upon\\r\\nit the foot sank.  He tried to draw it back; his other foot slipped, and\\r\\nhe fell prostrate, in his green and white uniform, into the treacherous\\r\\nbed of red mud.  His companions, who had halted upon the top of the hill,\\r\\nstood laughing, spectators of his misfortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that the poor boy with the black patch upon his eye, who had\\r\\nbeen ordered by Lady Diana to \"fall back\" and to \"keep at a distance,\"\\r\\nwas now coming up the hill; and the moment he saw our fallen hero, he\\r\\nhastened to his assistance.  He dragged poor Hal, who was a deplorable\\r\\nspectacle, out of the red mud.  The obliging mistress of a lodging house,\\r\\nas soon as she understood that the young gentleman was nephew to Mr.\\r\\nGresham, to whom she had formerly let her house, received Hal, covered as\\r\\nhe was with dirt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor Bristol lad hastened to Mr. Gresham\\'s for clean stockings and\\r\\nshoes for Hal.  He was unwilling to give up his uniform:  it was rubbed\\r\\nand rubbed, and a spot here and there was washed out; and he kept\\r\\ncontinually repeating,--\"When it\\'s dry it will all brush off--when it\\'s\\r\\ndry it will all brush off, won\\'t it?\"  But soon the fear of being too\\r\\nlate at the archery meeting began to balance the dread of appearing in\\r\\nhis stained habiliments; and he now as anxiously repeated, whilst the\\r\\nwoman held the wet coat to the fire, \"Oh, I shall be too late; indeed, I\\r\\nshall be too late; make haste; it will never dry; hold it nearer--nearer\\r\\nto the fire.  I shall lose my turn to shoot; oh, give me the coat; I\\r\\ndon\\'t mind how it is, if I can but get it on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHolding it nearer and nearer to the fire dried it quickly, to be sure;\\r\\nbut it shrunk it also, so that it was no easy matter to get the coat on\\r\\nagain.  However, Hal, who did not see the red splashes, which, in spite\\r\\nof all these operations, were too visible upon his shoulders, and upon\\r\\nthe skirts of his white coat behind, was pretty well satisfied to observe\\r\\nthat there was not one spot upon the facings.  \"Nobody,\" said he, \"will\\r\\ntake notice of my coat behind, I daresay.  I think it looks as smart\\r\\nalmost as ever!\"--and under this persuasion our young archer resumed his\\r\\nbow--his bow with green ribands, now no more!--and he pursued his way to\\r\\nthe Downs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll his companions were far out of sight.  \"I suppose,\" said he to his\\r\\nfriend with the black patch--\"I suppose my uncle and Ben had left home\\r\\nbefore you went for the shoes and stockings for me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes, sir; the butler said they had been gone to the Downs a matter\\r\\nof a good half-hour or more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHal trudged on as fast as he possibly could.  When he got upon the Downs,\\r\\nhe saw numbers of carriages, and crowds of people, all going towards the\\r\\nplace of meeting at the Ostrich.  He pressed forwards.  He was at first\\r\\nso much afraid of being late, that he did not take notice of the mirth\\r\\nhis motley appearance excited in all beholders.  At length he reached the\\r\\nappointed spot.  There was a great crowd of people.  In the midst he\\r\\nheard Lady Diana\\'s loud voice betting upon someone who was just going to\\r\\nshoot at the mark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So then the shooting is begun, is it?\" said Hal.  \"Oh, let me in! pray\\r\\nlet me into the circle!  I\\'m one of the archers--I am, indeed; don\\'t you\\r\\nsee my green and white uniform?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your red and white uniform, you mean,\" said the man to whom he addressed\\r\\nhimself; and the people, as they opened a passage for him, could not\\r\\nrefrain laughing at the mixture of dirt and finery which it exhibited.\\r\\nIn vain, when he got into the midst of the formidable circle, he looked\\r\\nto his friends, the young Sweepstakes, for their countenance and support.\\r\\nThey were amongst the most unmerciful of the laughers.  Lady Diana also\\r\\nseemed more to enjoy than to pity his confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why could you not keep your hat upon your head, man?\" said she, in her\\r\\nmasculine tone.  \"You have been almost the ruin of my poor uniform habit;\\r\\nbut I\\'ve escaped rather better than you have.  Don\\'t stand there, in the\\r\\nmiddle of the circle, or you\\'ll have an arrow in your eyes just now, I\\'ve\\r\\na notion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHal looked round in search of better friends.  \"Oh, where\\'s my uncle?--\\r\\nwhere\\'s Ben?\" said he.  He was in such confusion, that, amongst the\\r\\nnumber of faces, he could scarcely distinguish one from another; but he\\r\\nfelt somebody at this moment pull his elbow, and, to his great relief, he\\r\\nheard the friendly voice, and saw the good natured face of his Cousin\\r\\nBen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come back; come behind these people,\" said Ben, \"and put on my great-\\r\\ncoat; here it is for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRight glad was Hal to cover his disgraced uniform with the rough great-\\r\\ncoat which he had formerly despised.  He pulled the stained, drooping\\r\\ncockade out of his unfortunate hat; and he was now sufficiently recovered\\r\\nfrom his vexation to give an intelligible account of his accident to his\\r\\nuncle and Patty, who anxiously inquired what had detained him so long,\\r\\nand what had been the matter.  In the midst of the history of his\\r\\ndisaster, he was just proving to Patty that his taking the hatband to\\r\\nspin his top had nothing to do with his misfortune, and he was at the\\r\\nsame time endeavouring to refute his uncle\\'s opinion that the waste of\\r\\nthe whipcord that tied the parcel was the original cause of all his\\r\\nevils, when he was summoned to try his skill with his FAMOUS bow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My hands are benumbed; I can scarcely feel,\" said he, rubbing them, and\\r\\nblowing upon the ends of his fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, come,\" cried young Sweepstakes, \"I\\'m within one inch of the mark;\\r\\nwho\\'ll go nearer? I shall like to see.  Shoot away, Hal; but first\\r\\nunderstand our laws; we settled them before you came upon the green.  You\\r\\nare to have three shots, with your own bow and your own arrows; and\\r\\nnobody\\'s to borrow or lend under pretence of other\\'s bows being better or\\r\\nworse, or under any pretence.  Do you hear, Hal?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis young gentleman had good reasons for being so strict in these laws,\\r\\nas he had observed that none of his companions had such an excellent bow\\r\\nas he had provided for himself.  Some of the boys had forgotten to bring\\r\\nmore than one arrow with them, and by his cunning regulation that each\\r\\nperson should shoot with their own arrows, many had lost one or two of\\r\\ntheir shots.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a lucky fellow; you have your three arrows,\" said young\\r\\nSweepstakes.  \"Come, we can\\'t wait whilst you rub your fingers, man--\\r\\nshoot away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHal was rather surprised at the asperity with which his friend spoke.  He\\r\\nlittle knew how easily acquaintance who call themselves friends can\\r\\nchange when their interest comes in the slightest degree in competition\\r\\nwith their friendship.  Hurried by his impatient rival, and with his\\r\\nhands so much benumbed that he could scarcely feel how to fix the arrow\\r\\nin the string, he drew the bow.  The arrow was within a quarter of an\\r\\ninch of Master Sweepstakes\\' mark, which was the nearest that had yet been\\r\\nhit.  Hal seized his second arrow.  \"If I have any luck--\" said he.  But\\r\\njust as he pronounced the word LUCK, and as he bent his bow, the string\\r\\nbroke in two, and the bow fell from his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There, it\\'s all over with you!\" cried Master Sweepstakes, with a\\r\\ntriumphant laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here\\'s my bow for him, and welcome,\" said Ben.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, sir,\" said Master Sweepstakes, \"that is not fair; that\\'s against\\r\\nthe regulation.  You may shoot with your own bow, if you choose it, or\\r\\nyou may not, just as you think proper; but you must not lend it, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now Ben\\'s turn to make his trial.  His first arrow was not\\r\\nsuccessful.  His second was exactly as near as Hal\\'s first.  \"You have\\r\\nbut one more,\" said Master Sweepstakes--\"now for it!\"  Ben, before he\\r\\nventured his last arrow, prudently examined the string of his bow; and,\\r\\nas he pulled it to try its strength, it cracked.  Master Sweepstakes\\r\\nclapped his hands with loud exultations and insulting laughter.  But his\\r\\nlaughter ceased when our provident hero calmly drew from his pocket an\\r\\nexcellent piece of whip cord.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The everlasting whip cord, I declare!\" exclaimed Hal, when he saw that\\r\\nit was the very same that had tied up the parcel.  \"Yes,\" said Ben, as he\\r\\nfastened it to his bow, \"I put it into my pocket, to-day, on purpose,\\r\\nbecause I thought I might happen to want it.\"  He drew his bow the third\\r\\nand last time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, papa!\" cried little Patty, as his arrow hit the mark, \"it\\'s the\\r\\nnearest; is it not the nearest?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMaster Sweepstakes, with anxiety, examined the hit.  There could be no\\r\\ndoubt.  Ben was victorious!  The bow, the prize bow, was now delivered to\\r\\nhim; and Hal, as he looked at the whip-cord exclaimed, \"How LUCKY this\\r\\nwhip-cord has been to you, Ben!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is LUCKY, perhaps you mean, that he took care of it,\" said Mr.\\r\\nGresham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay,\" said Hal, \"very true; he might well say, \\'Waste not, want not.\\'  It\\r\\nis a good thing to have two strings to one\\'s bow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOLD POZ.\\r\\n\\r\\n          LUCY, daughter to the Justice.\\r\\n          MRS.

You can\\'t see him, so go about your\\r\\nbusiness, I say.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  To whom are you speaking, William?  Who\\'s that?\\r\\n\\r\\nWill.  Only an old man, miss, with a complaint for my master.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Oh, then, don\\'t send him away--don\\'t send him away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill.  But master has not had his chocolate, ma\\'am.  He won\\'t ever see\\r\\nanybody before he drinks his chocolate, you know, ma\\'am.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  But let the old man, then, come in here.  Perhaps he can wait a\\r\\nlittle while.  Call him.                (Exit Servant.)\\r\\n\\r\\n(Lucy sings, and goes on watering her myrtles; the servant shows in the\\r\\nOld Man.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWill.  You can\\'t see my master this hour; but miss will let you stay\\r\\nhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy (aside).  Poor old man! how he trembles as he walks.  (Aloud.) Sit\\r\\ndown, sit down.  My father will see you soon; pray sit down.\\r\\n\\r\\n(He hesitates; she pushes a chair towards him.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Pray sit down.                     (He sits down.)\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Man.  You are very good, miss; very good.  (Lucy goes to her myrtles\\r\\nagain.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Ah! I\\'m afraid this poor myrtle is quite dead--quite dead.\\r\\n(The Old Man sighs, and she turns round.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy (aside).  I wonder what can make him sigh so!  (Aloud.)  My father\\r\\nwon\\'t make you wait long.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Oh, ma\\'am, as long as he pleases.  I\\'m in no haste--no haste.\\r\\nIt\\'s only a small matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  But does a small matter make you sigh so?\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Ah, miss; because, though it is a small matter in itself, it is\\r\\nnot a small matter to me (sighing again); it was my all, and I\\'ve lost\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  What do you mean?  What have you lost?\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Why, miss--but I won\\'t trouble you about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  But it won\\'t trouble me at all--I mean, I wish to hear it; so tell\\r\\nit me.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Why, miss, I slept last night at the inn here, in town--the\\r\\n\"Saracen\\'s Head\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy (interrupts him).  Hark! there is my father coming downstairs;\\r\\nfollow me.  You may tell me your story as we go along.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  I slept at the \"Saracen\\'s Head,\" miss, and--\\r\\n                                          (Exit, talking.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE II.\\r\\n\\r\\nJustice Headstrong\\'s Study.\\r\\n\\r\\n(He appears in his nightgown and cap, with his gouty foot upon a stool--a\\r\\ntable and chocolate beside him--Lucy is leaning on the arm of his chair.)\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Well, well, my darling, presently; I\\'ll see him presently.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Whilst you are drinking your chocolate, papa?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  No, no, no--I never see anybody till I have done my chocolate,\\r\\ndarling.  (He tastes his chocolate.)  There\\'s no sugar in this, child.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Yes, indeed, papa.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  No, child--there\\'s NO sugar, I tell you; that poz!\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Oh, but, papa, I assure you I put in two lumps myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  There\\'s NO sugar, I say; why will you contradict me, child, for\\r\\never?  There\\'s no sugar, I say.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Lucy leans over him playfully, and with his teaspoon pulls out two lumps\\r\\nof sugar.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  What\\'s this, papa?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Pshaw! pshaw! pshaw!--it is not melted, child--it is the same as\\r\\nno sugar!.--Oh, my foot, girl, my foot!--you kill me.  Go, go, I\\'m busy.\\r\\nI\\'ve business to do.  Go and send William to me; do you hear, love?\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  And the old man, papa?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  What old man?  I tell you what, I\\'ve been plagued ever since I was\\r\\nawake, and before I was awake, about that old man.  If he can\\'t wait, let\\r\\nhim go about his business.  Don\\'t you know, child, I never see anybody\\r\\ntill I\\'ve drunk my chocolate; and I never will, if it were a duke--that\\'s\\r\\npoz!  Why, it has but just struck twelve; if he can\\'t wait, he can go\\r\\nabout his business, can\\'t he?\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Oh, sir, he can wait.  It was not he who was impatient.  (She\\r\\ncomes back playfully.)  It was only I, papa; don\\'t be angry.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Well, well, well (finishing his cup of chocolate, and pushing his\\r\\ndish away); and at anyrate there was not sugar enough.  Send William,\\r\\nsend William, child; and I\\'ll finish my own business, and then--\\r\\n                (Exit Lucy, dancing, \"And then!--and then!\")\\r\\n\\r\\n                        JUSTICE, alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Oh, this foot of mine!--(twinges)--Oh, this foot!  Ay, if Dr.\\r\\nSparerib could cure one of the gout, then, indeed, I should think\\r\\nsomething of him; but, as to my leaving off my bottle of port, it\\'s\\r\\nnonsense; it\\'s all nonsense; I can\\'t do it; I can\\'t, and won\\'t, for all\\r\\nthe Dr. Spareribs in Christendom; that\\'s poz!\\r\\n\\r\\n                        Enter WILLIAM.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  William--oh! ay! hey! what answer, pray, did you bring from the\\r\\n\"Saracen\\'s Head\"?  Did you see Mrs. Bustle herself, as I bid you?\\r\\n\\r\\nWill.  Yes, sir, I saw the landlady herself; she said she would come up\\r\\nimmediately, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Ah, that\\'s well--immediately?\\r\\n\\r\\nWill.  Yes, sir, and I hear her voice below now.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Oh, show her up; show Mrs. Bustle in.\\r\\n\\r\\n         Enter Mrs. BUSTLE, the landlady of the \"Saracen\\'s Head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Good morrow to your worship!  I\\'m glad to see your worship look so\\r\\npurely.  I came up with all speed (taking breath).  Our pie is in the\\r\\noven; that was what you sent for me about, I take it.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  True; true; sit down, good Mrs. Bustle, pray--\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Oh, your worship\\'s always very good (settling her apron).  I came\\r\\nup just as I was--only threw my shawl over me.  I thought your worship\\r\\nwould excuse--I\\'m quite, as it were, rejoiced to see your worship look so\\r\\npurely, and to find you up so hearty--\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Oh, I\\'m very hearty (coughing), always hearty, and thankful for\\r\\nit.  I hope to see many Christmas doings yet, Mrs. Bustle.  And so our\\r\\npie is in the oven, I think you say?\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  In the oven it is.  I put it in with my own hands; and if we have\\r\\nbut good luck in the baking, it will be as pretty a goose-pie--though I\\r\\nsay it that should not say it--as pretty a goose-pie as ever your worship\\r\\nset your eyes upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Will you take a glass of anything this morning, Mrs. Bustle?--I\\r\\nhave some nice usquebaugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Oh, no, your worship!--I thank your worship, though, as much as if\\r\\nI took it; but I just took my luncheon before I came up; or more proper,\\r\\nMY SANDWICH, I should say, for the fashion\\'s sake, to be sure.  A\\r\\nLUNCHEON won\\'t go down with nobody nowadays (laughs).  I expect hostler\\r\\nand boots will be calling for their sandwiches just now (laughs again).\\r\\nI\\'m sure I beg your worship\\'s pardon for mentioning a LUNCHEON.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Oh, Mrs. Bustle, the word\\'s a good word, for it means a good\\r\\nthing--ha! ha! ha! (pulls out his watch); but pray, is it luncheon time.\\r\\nWhy, it\\'s past one, I declare; and I thought I was up in remarkably good\\r\\ntime, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Well, and to be sure so it was, remarkably good time for your\\r\\nworship; but folks in our way must be up betimes, you know.  I\\'ve been up\\r\\nand about these seven hours!\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  (stretching).  Seven hours!\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Ay, indeed--eight, I might say, for I am an early little body;\\r\\nthough I say it that should not say it--I AM an early little body.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  An early little body, as you say, Mrs. Bustle; so I shall have my\\r\\ngoose-pie for dinner, hey?\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  For dinner, as sure as the clock strikes four--but I mustn\\'t stay\\r\\nprating, for it may be spoiling if I\\'m away; so I must wish your worship\\r\\na good morning.  (She curtsies.)\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  No ceremony--no ceremony; good Mrs. Bustle, your servant.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter William, to take away the chocolate.  The Landlady is putting on\\r\\nher shawl.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  You may let that man know, William, that I have dispatched my OWN\\r\\nbusiness, and am at leisure for his now (taking a pinch of snuff).  Hum!\\r\\npray, William (Justice leans back gravely), what sort of a looking fellow\\r\\nis he, pray?\\r\\n\\r\\nWill.  Most like a sort of travelling man, in my opinion, sir--or\\r\\nsomething that way, I take it,\\r\\n\\r\\n(At these words the landlady turns round inquisitively, and delays, that\\r\\nshe may listen, while she is putting on and pinning her shawl.)\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Hum! a sort of a travelling man.  Hum! lay my books out open at\\r\\nthe title Vagrant; and, William, tell the cook that Mrs. Bustle promises\\r\\nme the goose-pie for dinner.  Four o\\'clock, do you hear?  And show the\\r\\nold man in now.\\r\\n\\r\\n(The Landlady looks eagerly towards the door, as it opens, and exclaims,)\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  My old gentleman, as I hope to breathe!\\r\\n\\r\\n                     Enter the OLD MAN.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Lucy follows the Old Man on tiptoe--The Justice leans back and looks\\r\\nconsequential--The Landlady sets her arms akimbo--The Old Man starts as\\r\\nhe sees her.)\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  What stops you, friend?  Come forward, if you please.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  (advancing).  So, sir, is it you, sir?  Ay, you little thought, I\\r\\nwarrant ye, to meet me here with his worship; but there you reckoned\\r\\nwithout your host--Out of the frying-pan into the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  What is all this?  What is this?\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  (running on).  None of your flummery stuff will go down with his\\r\\nworship no more than with me, I give you warning; so you may go further\\r\\nand fare worse, and spare your breath to cool your porridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  (waves his hand with dignity).  Mrs. Bustle, good Mrs. Bustle,\\r\\nremember where you are.  Silence! silence!  Come forward, sir, and let me\\r\\nhear what you have to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n(The Old Man comes forward.)\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Who and what may you be, friend, and what is your business with\\r\\nme?\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Sir, if your worship will give me leave--\\r\\n\\r\\n                        (Justice makes a sign to her to be silent).\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Please, your worship, I am an old soldier.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  (interrupting).  An old hypocrite, say.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Mrs. Bustle, pray, I desire, let the man speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  For these two years past--ever since, please your worship--I\\r\\nwasn\\'t able to work any longer; for in my youth I did work as well as the\\r\\nbest of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand. (eager to interrupt).  You work--you--\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Let him finish his story, I say.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Ay, do, do, papa, speak for him.  Pray, Mrs. Bustle--\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  (turning suddenly round to Lucy).  Miss, a good morrow to you,\\r\\nma\\'am.  I humbly beg your apologies for not seeing you sooner, Miss Lucy.\\r\\n            (Justice nods to the Old Man, who goes on.)\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Man.  But please your worship, it pleased God to take away the use of\\r\\nmy left arm; and since that I have never been able to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Flummery! flummery!\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  (angrily).  Mrs. Bustle, I have desired silence, and I will have\\r\\nit, that\\'s poz!  You shall have your turn presently.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  For these two years past (for why should I be ashamed to tell the\\r\\ntruth?) I have lived upon charity, and I scraped together a guinea and a\\r\\nhalf and upwards, and I was travelling with it to my grandson, in the\\r\\nnorth, with him to end my days--but (sighing)--\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  But what?  Proceed, pray, to the point.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  But last night I slept here in town, please your worship, at the\\r\\n\"Saracen\\'s Head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  (in a rage).  At the \"Saracen\\'s Head\"!  Yes, forsooth! none such\\r\\never slept at the \"Saracen\\'s Head\" afore, or shall afterwards, as long as\\r\\nmy name\\'s Bustle, and the \"Saracen\\'s Head\" is the \"Saracen\\'s Head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Again! again!  Mrs. Landlady, this is downright--I have said you\\r\\nshould speak presently.  He SHALL speak first, since I\\'ve said it--that\\'s\\r\\npoz!  Speak on, friend.  You slept last night at the \"Saracen\\'s Head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Yes, please your worship, and I accuse nobody; but at night I had\\r\\nmy little money safe, and in the morning it was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Gone!--gone, indeed, in my house! and this is the way I\\'m to be\\r\\ntreated!  Is it so?  I couldn\\'t but speak, your worship, to such an\\r\\ninhuman like, out o\\' the way, scandalous charge, if King George and all\\r\\nthe Royal Family were sitting in your worship\\'s chair, beside you, to\\r\\nsilence me (turning to the Old Man).  And this is your gratitude,\\r\\nforsooth!  Didn\\'t you tell me that any hole in my house was good enough\\r\\nfor you, wheedling hypocrite?  And the thanks I receive is to call me and\\r\\nmine a pack of thieves.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Oh, no, no, no, NO--a pack of thieves, by no means.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Ay, I thought when _I_ came to speak we should have you upon your\\r\\nmarrow-bones in--\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  (imperiously).  Silence!  Five times have I commanded silence, and\\r\\nfive times in vain; and I won\\'t command anything five times in vain--\\r\\nTHAT\\'S POZ!\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  (in a pet, aside).  Old Poz! (aloud).  Then, your worship, I don\\'t\\r\\nsee any business I have to be waiting here; the folks want me at home\\r\\n(returning and whispering).  Shall I send the goose-pie up, your worship,\\r\\nif it\\'s ready?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  (with magnanimity).  I care not for the goose-pie, Mrs. Bustle.\\r\\nDo not talk to me of goose-pies; this is no place to talk of pies.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Oh, for that matter, your worship knows best, to be sure.\\r\\n                                      (Exit Landlady, angry.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE III.\\r\\n\\r\\n                  JUSTICE HEADSTRONG, OLD MAN and LUCY.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Ah, now, I\\'m glad he can speak; now tell papa; and you need not be\\r\\nafraid to speak to him, for he is very good-natured.  Don\\'t contradict\\r\\nhim, though, because he told ME not.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Oh, darling, YOU shall contradict me as often as you please--only\\r\\nnot before I\\'ve drunk my chocolate, child--hey!  Go on, my good friend;\\r\\nyou see what it is to live in Old England, where, thank Heaven, the\\r\\npoorest of His Majesty\\'s subjects may have justice, and speak his mind\\r\\nbefore the first in the land.  Now speak on; and you hear she tells you\\r\\nthat you need not be afraid of me.  Speak on.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  I thank your worship, I\\'m sure.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Thank me! for what, sir?  I won\\'t be thanked for doing justice,\\r\\nsir; so--but explain this matter.  You lost your money, hey, at the\\r\\n\"Saracen\\'s Head\"?  You had it safe last night, hey?--and you missed it\\r\\nthis morning?  Are you sure you had it safe at night?\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Oh, please your worship, quite sure; for I took it out and looked\\r\\nat it just before I said my prayers.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  You did--did ye so?--hum!  Pray, my good friend, where might you\\r\\nput your money when you went to bed?\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Please, your worship, where I always put it--always--in my\\r\\ntobacco-box.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Your tobacco-box!  I never heard of such a thing--to make a STRONG\\r\\nBOX of a tobacco-box.  Ha! ha! ha! hum!--and you say the box and all were\\r\\ngone in the morning?\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  No, please your worship, no; not the box--the box was never\\r\\nstirred from the place where I put it.  They left me the box.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Tut, tut, tut, man!--took the money and left the box?  I\\'ll never\\r\\nbelieve THAT!  I\\'ll never believe that anyone could be such a fool.  Tut,\\r\\ntut! the thing\\'s impossible!  It\\'s well you are not upon oath.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  If I were, please your worship, I should say the same; for it is\\r\\nthe truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Don\\'t tell me, don\\'t tell me; I say the thing is impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Please, your worship, here\\'s the box.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  (goes on without looking at it).  Nonsense! nonsense! it\\'s no such\\r\\nthing; it\\'s no such thing, I say--no man would take the money and leave\\r\\nthe tobacco-box.  I won\\'t believe it.  Nothing shall make me believe it\\r\\never--that\\'s poz.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy (takes the box, and holds it up before her father\\'s eyes).  You did\\r\\nnot see the box, did you, papa!\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Yes, yes, yes, child--nonsense! it\\'s all a lie from beginning to\\r\\nend.  A man who tells one lie will tell a hundred.  All a lie! all a lie!\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  If your worship would give me leave--\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Sir, it does not signify--it does not signify!  I\\'ve said it, I\\'ve\\r\\nsaid it, and that\\'s enough to convince me, and I\\'ll tell you more; if my\\r\\nLord Chief Justice of England told it to me, I would not believe it--\\r\\nthat\\'s poz!\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy (still playing with the box).  But how comes the box here, I wonder?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Pshaw! pshaw! pshaw! darling.  Go to your dolls, darling, and\\r\\ndon\\'t be positive--go to your dolls, and don\\'t talk of what you don\\'t\\r\\nunderstand.  What can you understand, I want to know, of the law?\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  No, papa, I didn\\'t mean about the law, but about the box; because,\\r\\nif the man had taken it, how could it be here, you know, papa?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Hey, hey, what?  Why, what I say is this, that I don\\'t dispute\\r\\nthat that box, that you hold in your hands, is a box; nay, for aught I\\r\\nknow, it may be a tobacco-box--but it\\'s clear to me that if they left the\\r\\nbox they did not take the money; and how do you dare, sir, to come before\\r\\nJustice Headstrong with a lie in your mouth; recollect yourself--I\\'ll\\r\\ngive you time to recollect yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              (A pause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Well, sir;, and what do you say now about the box?\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Please, your worship, with submission, I CAN say nothing but what\\r\\nI said before.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  What, contradict me again, after I gave you time to recollect\\r\\nyourself!  I\\'ve done with you; I have done.  Contradict me as often as\\r\\nyou please, but you cannot impose upon me; I defy you to impose upon me!\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Impose!\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  I know the law!--I know the law!--and I\\'ll make you know it, too.\\r\\nOne hour I\\'ll give you to recollect yourself, and if you don\\'t give up\\r\\nthis idle story, I\\'ll--I\\'ll commit you as a vagrant--that\\'s poz!  Go, go,\\r\\nfor the present.  William, take him into the servants\\' hall, do you\\r\\nhear?--What, take the money and leave the box?  I\\'ll never do it--that\\'s\\r\\npoz!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Lucy speaks to the Old Man as he is going off.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Don\\'t be frightened! don\\'t be frightened!--I mean, you tell the\\r\\ntruth, never be frightened.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  IF I tell the truth--(turning up his eyes).\\r\\n                   (Old Man is still held back by the young lady.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  One moment--answer me one question--because of something that just\\r\\ncame into my head.  Was the box shut fast when you left it?\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  No, miss, no!--open--it was open; for I could not find the lid in\\r\\nthe dark--my candle went out.  IF I tell the truth--oh!\\r\\n                                             (Exit.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSCENE IV.\\r\\n\\r\\n                Justice\\'s Study--the Justice is writing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Well!--I shall have but few days\\' more misery in this world!\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  (looks up).  Why! why--why then, why will you be so positive to\\r\\npersist in a lie?  Take the money and leave the box!  Obstinate\\r\\nblockhead!  Here, William (showing the committal), take this old\\r\\ngentleman to Holdfast, the constable, and give him this warrant.\\r\\n\\r\\n                  Enter Lucy, running, out of breath.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  I\\'ve found it!  I\\'ve found it!  Here, old man; here\\'s your money--\\r\\nhere it is all--a guinea and a half, and a shilling and a sixpence, just\\r\\nas he said, papa.\\r\\n\\r\\n                          Enter LANDLADY.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Oh la! your worship, did you ever hear the like?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  I\\'ve heard nothing yet that I can understand.  First, have you\\r\\nsecured the thief, I say?\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy (makes signs to the landlady to be silent).  Yes, yes, yes!--we have\\r\\nhim safe--we have him prisoner.  Shall he come in, papa?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Yes, child, by all means; and now I shall hear what possessed him\\r\\nto leave the box.  I don\\'t understand--there\\'s something deep in all\\r\\nthis; I don\\'t understand it.  Now I do desire, Mrs. Landlady, nobody may\\r\\nspeak a single word whilst I am cross-examining the thief.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Landlady puts her finger upon her lips--Everybody looks eagerly towards\\r\\nthe door.)\\r\\n\\r\\nRe-enter Lucy, with a huge wicker cage in her hand, containing a magpie--\\r\\nThe Justice drops the committal out of his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Hey!--what, Mrs. Landlady--the old magpie? hey?\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Ay, your worship, my old magpie.  Who\\'d have thought it?  Miss was\\r\\nvery clever; it was she caught the thief.  Miss was very clever.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Very good! very good!\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Ay, darling, her father\\'s own child!  How was it, child?  Caught\\r\\nthe thief, WITH THE MAINOUR, hey?  Tell us all; I will hear all--that\\'s\\r\\npoz!\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Oh! then first I must tell you how I came to suspect Mr. Magpie.\\r\\nDo you remember, papa, that day last summer, when I went with you to the\\r\\nbowling-green, at the \"Saracen\\'s Head\"?\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Oh, of all days in the year! but I ask pardon, miss.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Well, that day I heard my uncle and another gentleman telling\\r\\nstories of magpies hiding money; and they laid a wager about this old\\r\\nmagpie and they tried him--they put a shilling upon the table, and he ran\\r\\naway with it, and hid it; so I thought that he might do so again, you\\r\\nknow, this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Right, right.  It\\'s a pity, child, you are not upon the Bench; ha!\\r\\nha! ha!\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  And when I went to his old hiding place, there it was; but you\\r\\nsee, papa, he did not take the box.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  No, no, no! because the thief was a magpie.  No MAN would have\\r\\ntaken the money and left the box.  You see I was right; no MAN would have\\r\\nleft the box, hey?\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy.  Certainly not, I suppose; but I\\'m so very glad, old man, that you\\r\\nhave obtained your money.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Well then, child, here--take my purse, and add that to it.  We\\r\\nwere a little too hasty with the committal--hey?\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Ay, and I fear I was, too; but when one is touched about the\\r\\ncredit of one\\'s house, one\\'s apt to speak warmly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  Oh, I\\'m the happiest old man alive!  You are all convinced that I\\r\\ntold you no lies.  Say no more--say no more.  I am the happiest man!\\r\\nMiss, you have made me the happiest man alive!  Bless you for it!\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  Well now, I\\'ll tell you what.  I know what I think--you must keep\\r\\nthat there magpie, and make a show of him, and I warrant he\\'ll bring you\\r\\nmany an honest penny; for it\\'s a TRUE STORY, and folks would like to hear\\r\\nit, I hopes--\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  (eagerly).  And, friend, do you hear? you\\'ll dine here today,\\r\\nyou\\'ll dine here.  We have some excellent ale.  I will have you drink my\\r\\nhealth--that\\'s poz!--hey?  You\\'ll drink my health, won\\'t you--hey?\\r\\n\\r\\nOld M.  (bows).  Oh! and the young lady\\'s, if you please.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Ay, ay, drink her health--she deserves it.  Ay, drink my darling\\'s\\r\\nhealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand.  And please your worship, it\\'s the right time, I believe, to speak\\r\\nof the goose-pie now; and a charming pie it is, and it\\'s on the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill.  And Mr. Smack, the curate, and Squire Solid, and the doctor, sir,\\r\\nare come, and dinner is upon the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust.  Then let us say no more; but do justice immediately to the goose-\\r\\npie; and, darling, put me in mind to tell this story after dinner.\\r\\n(After they go out, the Justice stops.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell this story\"--I don\\'t know whether it tells well for me; but I\\'ll\\r\\nnever be positive any more--THAT\\'S POZ!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MIMIC.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Montague spent the summer of the year 1795 at Clifton with\\r\\ntheir son Frederick, and their two daughters Sophia and Marianne.  They\\r\\nhad taken much care of the education of their children; nor were they\\r\\never tempted, by any motive of personal convenience or temporary\\r\\namusement, to hazard the permanent happiness of their pupils.\\r\\n\\r\\nSensible of the extreme importance of early impressions, and of the\\r\\npowerful influence of external circumstances in forming the characters\\r\\nand the manners, they were now anxious that the variety of new ideas and\\r\\nnew objects which would strike the minds of their children should appear\\r\\nin a just point of view.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let children see and judge for themselves,\" is often inconsiderately\\r\\nsaid.  Where children see only a part they cannot judge of the whole; and\\r\\nfrom the superficial view which they can have in short visits and\\r\\ndesultory conversation, they can form only a false estimate of the\\r\\nobjects of human happiness, a false notion of the nature of society, and\\r\\nfalse opinions of characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the above reasons, Mr. and Mrs. Montague were particularly cautious\\r\\nin the choice of their acquaintances, as they were well aware that\\r\\nwhatever passed in conversation before children became part of their\\r\\neducation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to Clifton they wished to have a house entirely to\\r\\nthemselves, but, as they came late in the season, almost all the lodging\\r\\nhouses were full, and for a few weeks they were obliged to remain in a\\r\\nhouse where some of the apartments were already occupied.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first fortnight they scarcely saw or heard anything of one of\\r\\nthe families who lodged on the same floor with them.  An elderly quaker,\\r\\nand his sister Bertha, were their silent neighbours.  The blooming\\r\\ncomplexion of the lady had indeed attracted the attention of the\\r\\nchildren, as they caught a glimpse of her face when she was getting into\\r\\nher carriage to go out upon the Downs.  They could scarcely believe that\\r\\nshe came to the Wells on account of her health.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides her blooming complexion, the delicate white of her garments had\\r\\nstruck them with admiration; and they observed that her brother carefully\\r\\nguarded her dress from the wheel of the carriage, as he handed her in.\\r\\nFrom this circumstance, and from the benevolent countenance of the old\\r\\ngentleman, they concluded that he was very fond of his sister, and that\\r\\nthey were certainly very happy, except that they never spoke, and could\\r\\nbe seen only for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot so the maiden lady who occupied the ground floor.  On the stairs, in\\r\\nthe passages, at her window, she was continually visible; and she\\r\\nappeared to possess the art of being present in all these places at once.\\r\\nHer voice was eternally to be heard, and it was not particularly\\r\\nmelodious.  The very first day she met Mrs. Montague\\'s children on the\\r\\nstairs, she stopped to tell Marianne that she was a charming dear, and a\\r\\ncharming little dear; to kiss her, to inquire her name, and to inform her\\r\\nthat her own name was \"Mrs. Theresa Tattle,\" a circumstance of which\\r\\nthere was little danger of their long remaining in ignorance; for, in the\\r\\ncourse of one morning, at least twenty single and as many double raps at\\r\\nthe door were succeeded by vociferations of \"Mrs. Theresa Tattle\\'s\\r\\nservant!\"  \"Mrs. Theresa Tattle at home?\"   \"Mrs. Theresa Tattle not at\\r\\nhome!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo person at the Wells was oftener at home and abroad than Mrs. Tattle.\\r\\nShe had, as she deemed it, the happiness to have a most extensive\\r\\nacquaintance residing at Clifton.  She had for years kept a register of\\r\\narrivals.  She regularly consulted the subscriptions to the circulating\\r\\nlibraries, and the lists at the Ball and the Pump-rooms:  so that, with a\\r\\nmemory unencumbered with literature, and free from all domestic cares,\\r\\nshe contrived to retain a most astonishing and correct list of births,\\r\\ndeaths and marriages, together with all the anecdotes, amusing,\\r\\ninstructive, or scandalous, which are necessary to the conversation of a\\r\\nwater drinking place, and essential to the character of a \"very pleasant\\r\\nwoman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A very pleasant woman,\" Mrs. Tattle was usually called; and, conscious\\r\\nof her accomplishments, she was eager to introduce herself to the\\r\\nacquaintance of her new neighbours; having, with her ordinary expedition,\\r\\ncollected from their servants, by means of her own, all that could be\\r\\nknown, or rather, all that could be told about them.  The name of\\r\\nMontague, at all events, she knew was a good name, and justified in\\r\\ncourting the acquaintance.  She courted it first by nods, and becks and\\r\\nsmiles at Marianne whenever she met her; and Marianne, who was a very\\r\\nlittle girl, began presently to nod and smile in return, persuaded that a\\r\\nlady who smiled so much, could not be ill-natured.  Besides, Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa\\'s parlour door was sometimes left more than half open, to afford\\r\\na view of a green parrot.  Marianne sometimes passed very slowly by this\\r\\ndoor.  One morning it was left quite wide open, when she stopped to say\\r\\n\"Pretty Poll\"; and immediately Mrs. Tattle begged she would do her the\\r\\nhonour to walk in and see \"Pretty Poll,\" at the same time taking the\\r\\nliberty to offer her a piece of iced plum-cake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day Mrs. Theresa Tattle did herself the honour to wait upon Mrs.\\r\\nMontague, \"to apologize for the liberty she taken in inviting Mrs.\\r\\nMontague\\'s charming Miss Marianne into her apartment to see Pretty Poll,\\r\\nand for the still greater liberty she had taken in offering her a piece\\r\\nof plum-cake--inconsiderate creature that she was!--which might possibly\\r\\nhave disagreed with her, and which certainly were liberties she never\\r\\nshould have been induced to take, if she had not been unaccountably\\r\\nbewitched by Miss Marianne\\'s striking though highly flattering\\r\\nresemblance to a young gentleman (an officer) with whom she had danced,\\r\\nnow nearly twelve years ago, of the name of Montague, a most respectable\\r\\nyoung man, and of a most respectable family, with which, in a remote\\r\\ndegree, she might presume to say, she herself was someway connected,\\r\\nhaving the honour to be nearly related to the Joneses of Merionethshire,\\r\\nwho were cousins to the Mainwarings of Bedfordshire, who married into the\\r\\nfamily of the Griffiths, the eldest branch of which, she understood, had\\r\\nthe honour to be cousin-german to Mr. Montague; on which account she had\\r\\nbeen impatient to pay a visit, so likely to be productive of most\\r\\nagreeable consequences, by the acquisition of an acquaintance whose\\r\\nsociety must do her infinite honour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving thus happily accomplished her first visit, there seemed little\\r\\nprobability of escaping Mrs. Tattle\\'s further acquaintance.  In the\\r\\ncourse of the first week she only hinted to Mr. Montague that \"some\\r\\npeople thought his system of education rather odd; that she should be\\r\\nobliged to him if he would, some time or other, when he had nothing else\\r\\nto do, just sit down and make her understand his notions, that she might\\r\\nhave something to say to her acquaintance, as she always wished to have\\r\\nwhen she heard any friend attacked, or any friend\\'s opinions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Montague declining to sit down and make this lady understand a system\\r\\nof education only to give her something to say, and showing unaccountable\\r\\nindifference about the attacks with which he was threatened, Mrs. Tattle\\r\\nnext addressed herself to Mrs. Montague, prophesying, in a most serious\\r\\nwhisper, \"that the charming Miss Marianne would shortly and inevitably\\r\\ngrow quite crooked, if she were not immediately provided with a back-\\r\\nboard, a French dancing-master, and a pair of stocks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis alarming whisper could not, however, have a permanent effect upon\\r\\nMrs. Montague\\'s understanding, because three days afterwards Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa, upon the most anxious inspection, entirely mistook the just and\\r\\nnatural proportions of the hip and shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis danger vanishing, Mrs. Tattle presently, with a rueful length of\\r\\nface, and formal preface, \"hesitated to assure Mrs. Montague, that she\\r\\nwas greatly distressed about her daughter Sophy; that she was convinced\\r\\nher lungs were affected; and that she certainly ought to drink the waters\\r\\nmorning and evening; and above all things, must keep one of the patirosa\\r\\nlozenges constantly in her mouth, and directly consult Dr. Cardamum, the\\r\\nbest physician in the world, and the person she would send for herself\\r\\nupon her death-bed; because, to her certain knowledge, he had recovered a\\r\\nyoung lady, a relation of her own, after she had lost one whole GLOBE* of\\r\\nher lungs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n*Lobe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe medical opinion of a lady of so much anatomical precision could not\\r\\nhave much weight.  Neither was this universal adviser more successful in\\r\\nan attempt to introduce a tutor to Frederick, who, she apprehended, must\\r\\nwant some one to perfect him in the Latin and Greek, and dead languages,\\r\\nof which, she observed, it would be impertinent for a woman to talk; only\\r\\nshe might venture to repeat what she had heard said by good authority,\\r\\nthat a competency of the dead tongues could be had nowhere but at a\\r\\npublic school, or else from a private tutor who had been abroad (after\\r\\nthe advantage of a classical education, finished in one of the\\r\\nuniversities) with a good family; without which introduction it was idle\\r\\nto think of reaping solid advantages from any continental tour; all which\\r\\nrequisites, from personal knowledge, she could aver to be concentrated in\\r\\nthe gentleman she had the honour to recommend, as having been tutor to a\\r\\nyoung nobleman, who had now no further occasion for him, having,\\r\\nunfortunately for himself and his family, been killed in an untimely\\r\\nduel.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Mrs. Theresa Tattle\\'s suggestions being lost upon these stoical\\r\\nparents, her powers were next tried upon the children, and her success\\r\\nsoon became apparent.  On Sophy, indeed, she could not make any\\r\\nimpression, though she had expended on her some of her finest strokes of\\r\\nflattery.  Sophy, though very desirous of the approbation of her friends,\\r\\nwas not very desirous of winning the favour of strangers.  She was about\\r\\nthirteen--that dangerous age at which ill educated girls, in their\\r\\nanxiety to display their accomplishments, are apt to become dependent for\\r\\napplause upon the praise of every idle visitor; when the habits not being\\r\\nformed, and the attention being suddenly turned to dress and manners,\\r\\ngirls are apt to affect and imitate, indiscriminately, everything that\\r\\nthey conceive to be agreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nSophy, whose taste had been cultivated at the same time with her powers\\r\\nof reasoning, was not liable to fall into these errors.  She found that\\r\\nshe could please those whom she wished to please, without affecting to be\\r\\nanything but what she really was; and her friends listened to what she\\r\\nsaid, though she never repeated the sentiments, or adopted the phrases,\\r\\nwhich she might easily have copied from the conversation of those who\\r\\nwere older or more fashionable than herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis word FASHIONABLE, Mrs. Theresa Tattle knew, had usually a great\\r\\neffect, even at thirteen; but she had not observed that it had much power\\r\\nupon Sophy; nor were her remarks concerning grace and manners much\\r\\nattended to.  Her mother had taught Sophy that it was best to let herself\\r\\nalone, and not to distort either her person or her mind in acquiring\\r\\ngrimace, which nothing but the fashion of the moment can support, and\\r\\nwhich is always detected and despised by people of real good sense and\\r\\npoliteness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bless me!\" said Mrs. Tattle, to herself, \"if I had such a tall daughter,\\r\\nand so unformed, before my eyes from morning to night, it would certainly\\r\\nbreak my poor heart.  Thank heaven, I am not a mother! if I were, Miss\\r\\nMarianne for me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Marianne had heard so often from Mrs. Tattle that she was very\\r\\ncharming, that she could not help believing it; and from being a very\\r\\npleasing, unaffected little girl, she in a short time grew so conceited,\\r\\nthat she could neither speak, look, nor be silent without imagining that\\r\\neverybody was, or ought to be, looking at her; and when Mrs. Theresa saw\\r\\nthat Mrs. Montague looked very grave upon these occasions, she, to repair\\r\\nthe ill she had done, would say, after praising Marianne\\'s hair or her\\r\\neyes, \"Oh, but little ladies should never think about their beauty, you\\r\\nknow.  Nobody loves anybody for being handsome, but for being good.\"\\r\\nPeople must think children are very silly, or else they can never have\\r\\nreflected upon the nature of belief in their own minds, if they imagine\\r\\nthat children will believe the words that are said to them, by way of\\r\\nmoral, when the countenance, manner, and every concomitant circumstance\\r\\ntell them a different tale.  Children are excellent physiognomists--they\\r\\nquickly learn the universal language of looks; and what is said OF them\\r\\nalways makes a greater impression than what is said TO them, a truth of\\r\\nwhich those prudent people surely cannot be aware who comfort themselves,\\r\\nand apologize to parents, by saying, \"Oh, but I would not say so and so\\r\\nto the child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Theresa had seldom said to Frederick Montague, \"that he had a vast\\r\\ndeal of drollery, and was a most incomparable mimic;\" but she had said so\\r\\nof him in whispers, which magnified the sound to his imagination, if not\\r\\nto his ear.  He was a boy of much vivacity, and had considerable\\r\\nabilities; but his appetite for vulgar praise had not yet been surfeited.\\r\\nEven Mrs. Theresa Tattle\\'s flattery pleased him, and he exerted himself\\r\\nfor her entertainment so much that he became quite a buffoon.  Instead of\\r\\nobserving characters and manners, that he might judge of them, and form\\r\\nhis own, he now watched every person he saw, that he might detect some\\r\\nfoible, or catch some singularity in their gesture or pronunciation,\\r\\nwhich he might successfully mimic.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlarmed by the rapid progress of these evils, Mr. and Mrs. Montague, who,\\r\\nfrom the first day that they had been honoured with Mrs. Tattle\\'s visit,\\r\\nhad begun to look out for new lodgings, were now extremely impatient to\\r\\ndecamp.  They were not people who, from the weak fear of offending a\\r\\nsilly acquaintance, would hazard the happiness of their family.  They had\\r\\nheard of a house in the country which was likely to suit them, and they\\r\\ndetermined to go directly to look at it.  As they were to be absent all\\r\\nday, they foresaw that their officious neighbour would probably interfere\\r\\nwith their children.  They did not choose to exact any promise from them\\r\\nwhich they might be tempted to break, and therefore they only said at\\r\\nparting, \"If Mrs. Theresa Tattle should ask you to come to her, do as you\\r\\nthink proper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely had Mrs. Montague\\'s carriage got out of hearing when a note was\\r\\nbrought, directed to \"Frederick Montague, Junior, Esq.,\" which he\\r\\nimmediately opened, and read as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Theresa Tattle presents her very best compliments to the\\r\\nentertaining Mr. Frederick Montague; she hopes he will have the charity\\r\\nto drink tea with her this evening, and bring his charming sister, Miss\\r\\nMarianne, with him, as Mrs. Theresa will be quite alone with a shocking\\r\\nheadache, and is sensible her nerves are affected; and Dr. Cardamum says\\r\\nthat (especially in Mrs. T. T.\\'s case) it is downright death to nervous\\r\\npatients to be alone an instant.  She therefore trusts Mr. Frederick will\\r\\nnot refuse to come and make her laugh.  Mrs. Theresa has taken care to\\r\\nprovide a few macaroons for her little favourite, who said she was\\r\\nparticularly fond of them the other day.  Mrs. Theresa hopes they will\\r\\nall come at six, or before, not forgetting Miss Sophy, if she will\\r\\ncondescend to be of the party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the first reading of this note, \"the entertaining\" Mr. Frederick, and\\r\\nthe \"charming\" Miss Marianne laughed heartily, and looked at Sophy, as if\\r\\nthey were afraid that she should think it possible they could like such\\r\\ngross flattery; but upon a second perusal, Marianne observed that it\\r\\ncertainly was very good-natured of Mrs. Theresa to remember the\\r\\nmacaroons; and Frederick allowed that it was wrong to laugh at the poor\\r\\nwoman because she had the headache.  Then twisting the note in his\\r\\nfingers, he appealed to Sophy:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Sophy, leave off drawing for an instant,\" said Frederick, \"and\\r\\ntell us what answer can we send?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can!--we can send what answer we please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I know that,\" said Frederick.  \"I would refuse if I could; but we\\r\\nought not to do anything rude, should we?  So I think we might as well\\r\\ngo, because we could not refuse, if we would, I say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have made such confusion,\" replied Sophy, \"between \\'couldn\\'t\\' and\\r\\n\\'wouldn\\'t\\' and \\'shouldn\\'t,\\' that I can\\'t understand you; surely they are\\r\\nall different things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Different! no,\" cried Frederick--\"could, would, should, might, and\\r\\nought, are all the same thing in the Latin grammar; all of \\'em signs of\\r\\nthe potential mood, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSophy, whose powers of reasoning were not to be confounded, even by\\r\\nquotations from the Latin grammar, looked up soberly from her drawing,\\r\\nand answered \"that very likely those words might be signs of the same\\r\\nthing in the Latin grammar, but she believed that they meant perfectly\\r\\ndifferent things in real life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s just as people please,\" said her sophistical brother.  \"You know\\r\\nwords mean nothing in themselves.  If I choose to call my hat my\\r\\ncadwallader, you would understand me just as well, after I had once\\r\\nexplained it to you, that by cadwallader I meant this black thing that I\\r\\nput upon my head; cadwallader and hat would then be just the same thing\\r\\nto you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then why have two words for the same thing?\" said Sophy; \"and what has\\r\\nthis to do with \\'could\\' and \\'should\\'?  You wanted to prove--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wanted to prove,\" interrupted Frederick, \"that it\\'s not worth while to\\r\\ndispute for two hours about two words.  Do keep to the point, Sophy, and\\r\\ndon\\'t dispute with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was not disputing, I was reasoning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, reasoning or disputing.  Women have no business to do either; for,\\r\\nhow should they know how to chop logic like men?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this contemptuous sarcasm upon her sex, Sophy\\'s colour rose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There!\" cried Frederick, exulting, \"now we shall see a philosopheress in\\r\\na passion; I\\'d give sixpence, half-price, for a harlequin entertainment,\\r\\nto see Sophy in a passion.  Now, Marianne, look at her brush dabbing so\\r\\nfast in the water!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSophy, who could not easily bear to be laughed at, with some little\\r\\nindignation, said, \"Brother, I wish--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There! there!\" cried Frederick, pointing to the colour which rose in her\\r\\ncheeks almost to her temples--\"rising! rising! rising! look at the\\r\\nthermometer! blood heat! blood! fever heat! boiling water heat!\\r\\nMarianne.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" said Sophy, smiling, \"you should stand a little farther off, both\\r\\nof you.  Leave the thermometer to itself a little while.  Give it time to\\r\\ncool.  It will come down to \\'temperate\\' by the time you look again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, brother!\" cried Marianne, \"she\\'s so good-humoured, don\\'t tease her\\r\\nany more, and don\\'t draw heads upon her paper, and don\\'t stretch her\\r\\nindia-rubber, and don\\'t let us dirty any more of her brushes.  See! the\\r\\nsides of her tumbler are all manner of colours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I only mixed red, blue, green and yellow, to show you, Marianne,\\r\\nthat all colours mixed together make white.  But she is temperate now,\\r\\nand I won\\'t plague her; she shall chop logic, if she likes it, though she\\r\\nis a woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that\\'s not fair, brother,\" said Marianne, \"to say \\'woman\\' in that\\r\\nway.  I\\'m sure Sophy found out how to tie that difficult knot, which papa\\r\\nshowed us yesterday, long before you did, though you are a man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not long,\" said Frederick.  \"Besides, that was only a conjuring trick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was very ingenious, though,\" said Marianne; \"and papa said so.\\r\\nBesides, she understood the \\'Rule of Three,\\' which was no conjuring\\r\\ntrick, better than you did, though she is a woman; and she can reason,\\r\\ntoo, mamma says.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, let her reason away,\" said the provoking wit.  \"All I have to\\r\\nsay is, that she\\'ll never be able to make a pudding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not, pray, brother?\" inquired Sophy, looking up again, very gravely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, you know papa himself, the other day at dinner, said that the woman\\r\\nwho talks Greek and Latin as well as I do, is a fool after all; and that\\r\\nshe had better have learned something useful; and Mrs. Tattle said, she\\'d\\r\\nanswer for it she did not know how to make a pudding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well! but I am not talking Greek and Latin, am I?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, but you are drawing, and that\\'s the same thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The same thing!  Oh, Frederick!\" said little Marianne, laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may laugh; but I say it is the same sort of thing.  Women who are\\r\\nalways drawing and reasoning, never know how to make puddings.  Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa Tattle said so, when I showed her Sophy\\'s beautiful drawing\\r\\nyesterday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Theresa Tattle might say so,\" replied Sophy, calmly; \"but I do not\\r\\nperceive the reason, brother, why drawing should prevent me from learning\\r\\nhow to make a pudding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I say you\\'ll never learn how to make a good pudding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have learned,\" continued Sophy, who was mixing her colours, \"to mix\\r\\nsuch and such colours together to make the colour that I want; and why\\r\\nshould I not be able to learn to mix flour and butter, and sugar and egg,\\r\\ntogether, to produce the taste that I want.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, but mixing will never do, unless you know the quantities, like a\\r\\ncook; and you would never learn the right quantities.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did the cook learn them?  Cannot I learn them as she did?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but you\\'d never do it exactly, and mind the spoonfuls right, by the\\r\\nrecipe, like a cook.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed! indeed! but she would,\" cried Marianne, eagerly:  \"and a great\\r\\ndeal more exactly, for mamma has taught her to weigh and measure things\\r\\nvery carefully:  and when I was ill she always weighed the bark in\\r\\nnicely, and dropped my drops so carefully:  better than the cook.  When\\r\\nmamma took me down to see the cook make a cake once, I saw her spoonfuls,\\r\\nand her ounces, and her handfuls:  she dashed and splashed without\\r\\nminding exactness or the recipe, or anything.  I\\'m sure Sophy would make\\r\\na much better pudding, if exactness only were wanting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, granting that she could make the best pudding in the whole world,\\r\\nwhat does that signify?  I say she never would:  so it comes to the same\\r\\nthing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never would! how can you tell that, brother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, now look at her, with her books, and her drawings, and all this\\r\\napparatus.  Do you think she would ever jump up, with all her nicety,\\r\\ntoo, and put by all these things, to go down into the greasy kitchen, and\\r\\nplump up to the elbows in suet, like a cook, for a plum-pudding?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I need not plump up to the elbows, brother,\" said Sophy, smiling:  \"nor\\r\\nis it necessary that I should be a cook:  but, if it were necessary, I\\r\\nhope I should be able to make a pudding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes,\" cried Marianne, warmly; \"and she would jump up, and put by\\r\\nall her things in a minute if it were necessary, and run down stairs and\\r\\nup again like lightning, or do anything that was ever so disagreeable to\\r\\nher, even about the suet, with all her nicety, brother, I assure you, as\\r\\nshe used to do anything, everything for me, when I was ill last winter.\\r\\nOh, brother, she can do anything; and she could make the best plum-\\r\\npudding in the whole world, I\\'m sure, in a minute, if it were necessary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II.\\r\\n\\r\\nA knock at the door, from Mrs. Theresa Tattle\\'s servant, recalled\\r\\nMarianne to the business of the day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There,\" said Frederick, \"we have sent no answer all this time.  It\\'s\\r\\nnecessary to think of that in a minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant came with his mistress\\' compliments, to let the young ladies\\r\\nand Mr. Frederick know that she was waiting tea for them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Waiting! then we must go,\" said Frederick.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant opened the door wider, to let him pass, and Marianne thought\\r\\nshe must follow her brother:  so they went downstairs together, while\\r\\nSophy gave her own message to the servant, and quietly stayed at her\\r\\nusual occupations.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Tattle was seated at her tea-table, with a large plate of macaroons\\r\\nbeside her when Frederick and Marianne entered.  She was \"delighted\" they\\r\\nwere come, and \"grieved\" not to see Miss Sophy along with them.  Marianne\\r\\ncoloured a little; for though she had precipitately followed her brother,\\r\\nand though he had quieted her conscience for a moment by saying \"You know\\r\\npapa and mamma told us to do what we thought best,\" yet she did not feel\\r\\nquite pleased with herself:  and it was not till after Mrs. Theresa had\\r\\nexhausted all her compliments, and half her macaroons, that she could\\r\\nrestore her spirits to their usual height.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Mr. Frederick,\" said she after tea, \"you promised to make me\\r\\nlaugh; and nobody can make me laugh so well as yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, brother,\" said Marianne, \"show Mrs. Theresa Dr. Carbuncle eating his\\r\\ndinner; and I\\'ll be Mrs. Carbuncle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne.  Now, my dear, what shall I help you to?\\r\\n\\r\\nFrederick. \"My dear!\" she never calls him my dear, you know, but always\\r\\nDoctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.  Well then, doctor, what will you eat to-day?\\r\\n\\r\\nFred.  Eat, madam! eat! nothing! nothing!  I don\\'t see anything here I\\r\\ncan eat, ma\\'am.\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.  Here\\'s eels, sir; let me help you to some eel--stewed eel;--you\\r\\nused to be fond of stewed eel.\\r\\n\\r\\nFred.  Used, ma\\'am, used!  But I\\'m sick of stewed eels.  You would tire\\r\\none of anything.  Am I to see nothing but eels?  And what\\'s this at the\\r\\nbottom?\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.  Mutton, doctor, roast mutton; if you\\'ll be so good as to cut it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFred.  Cut it, ma\\'am!  I can\\'t cut it, I say; it\\'s as hard as a deal\\r\\nboard.  You might as well tell me to cut the table, ma\\'am.  Mutton,\\r\\nindeed! not a bit of fat.  Roast mutton, indeed! not a drop of gravy.\\r\\nMutton, truly! quite a cinder.  I\\'ll have none of it.  Here, take it\\r\\naway; take it downstairs to the cook.  It\\'s a very hard case, Mrs.\\r\\nCarbuncle, that I can never have a bit of anything that I can eat at my\\r\\nown table, Mrs. Carbuncle, since I was married, ma\\'am, I that am the\\r\\neasiest man in the whole world to please about my dinner.  It\\'s really\\r\\nvery extraordinary, Mrs. Carbuncle!  What have you at that corner there,\\r\\nunder the cover?\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.  Patties, sir; oyster patties.\\r\\n\\r\\nFred.  Patties, ma\\'am! kickshaws!  I hate kickshaws.  Not worth putting\\r\\nunder a cover, ma\\'am.  And why not have glass covers, that one may see\\r\\none\\'s dinner before one, before it grows cold with asking questions, Mrs.\\r\\nCarbuncle, and lifting up covers?  But nobody has any sense:  and I see\\r\\nno water plates anywhere, lately.\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.  Do, pray, doctor, let me help you to a bit of chicken before it\\r\\ngets cold, my dear.\\r\\n\\r\\nFred. (aside).  \"My dear,\" again, Marianne!\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.  Yes, brother, because she is frightened, you know, and Mrs.\\r\\nCarbuncle always says \"my dear\" to him when she\\'s frightened, and looks\\r\\nso pale from side to side; and sometimes she cries before dinner\\'s done,\\r\\nand then all the company are quite silent, and don\\'t know what to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, such a little creature; to have so much sense, too!\" exclaimed Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa, with rapture.  \"Mr. Frederick, you\\'ll make me die with laughing!\\r\\nPray go on, Dr. Carbuncle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFred.  Well, ma\\'am, then if I must eat something, send me a bit of fowl;\\r\\na leg and wing, the liver wing, and a bit of the breast, oyster sauce,\\r\\nand a slice of that ham, if you please, ma\\'am.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Dr. Carbuncle eats voraciously, with his head down to his plate, and,\\r\\ndropping the sauce, he buttons up his coat tight across the breast.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFred.  Here; a plate, knife and fork, bit o\\' bread, a glass of Dorchester\\r\\nale!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, admirable!\" exclaimed Mrs. Tattle, clapping her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, brother, suppose that it is after dinner,\" said Marianne; \"and show\\r\\nus how the doctor goes to sleep.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrederick threw himself back in an arm-chair, leaning his head back, with\\r\\nhis mouth open, snoring; nodded from time to time, crossed and uncrossed\\r\\nhis legs, tried to awake himself by twitching his wig, settling his\\r\\ncollar, blowing his nose and rapping on the lid of his snuff-box.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll which infinitely diverted Mrs. Tattle, who, when she could stop\\r\\nherself from laughing, declared \"It made her sigh, too, to think of the\\r\\nlife poor Mrs. Carbuncle led with that man, and all for nothing, too; for\\r\\nher jointure was nothing, next to nothing, though a great thing, to be\\r\\nsure, her friends thought for her, when she was only Sally Ridgeway\\r\\nbefore she was married.  Such a wife as she makes,\" continued Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa, lifting up her hands and eyes to heaven, \"and so much as she has\\r\\ngone through, the brute ought to be ashamed of himself if he does not\\r\\nleave her something extraordinary in his will; for turn it which way she\\r\\nwill, she can never keep a carriage, or live like anybody else, on her\\r\\njointure, after all, she tells me, poor soul!  A sad prospect, after her\\r\\nhusband\\'s death, to look forward to, instead of being comfortable, as her\\r\\nfriends expected; and she, poor young thing! knowing no better when they\\r\\nmarried her!  People should look into these things, beforehand, or never\\r\\nmarry at all, I say, Miss Marianne.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Marianne, who did not clearly comprehend this affair of the\\r\\njointure, or the reason why Mrs. Carbuncle would be so unhappy after her\\r\\nhusband\\'s death, turned to Frederick, who was at that instant studying\\r\\nMrs. Theresa as a future character to mimic.  \"Brother,\" said Marianne,\\r\\n\"now sing an Italian song for us like Miss Croker.  Pray, Miss Croker,\\r\\nfavour us with a song.  Mrs. Theresa Tattle has never had the pleasure of\\r\\nhearing you sing; she\\'s quite impatient to hear you sing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed, I am,\" said Mrs. Theresa.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrederick put his hands before him affectedly; \"Oh, indeed, ma\\'am!\\r\\nindeed, ladies! I really am so hoarse, it distresses me so to be pressed\\r\\nto sing; besides, upon my word, I have quite left off singing.  I\\'ve\\r\\nnever sung once, except for very particular people, this winter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.  But Mrs. Theresa Tattle is a very particular person.  I\\'m sure\\r\\nyou\\'ll sing for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nFred.  Certainly, ma\\'am, I allow that you use a powerful argument; but I\\r\\nassure you now, I would do my best to oblige you, but I absolutely have\\r\\nforgotten all my English songs.  Nobody hears anything but Italian now,\\r\\nand I have been so giddy as to leave my Italian music behind me.\\r\\nBesides, I make it a rule never to hazard myself without an\\r\\naccompaniment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.  Oh, try, Miss Croker, for once.\\r\\n\\r\\n              [Frederick sings, after much preluding.]\\r\\n\\r\\n     Violante in the pantry,\\r\\n     Gnawing of a mutton-bone;\\r\\n          How she gnawed it,\\r\\n          How she claw\\'d it,\\r\\n     When she found herself alone!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Charming!\" exclaimed Mrs. Tattle; \"so like Miss Croker, I\\'m sure I shall\\r\\nthink of you, Mr. Frederick, when I hear her asked to sing again.  Her\\r\\nvoice, however, introduces her to very pleasant parties, and she\\'s a girl\\r\\nthat\\'s very much taken notice of, and I don\\'t doubt will go off vastly\\r\\nwell.  She\\'s a particular favourite of mine, you must know; and I mean to\\r\\ndo her a piece of service the first opportunity, by saying something or\\r\\nother, that shall go round to her relations in Northumberland, and make\\r\\nthem do something for her; as well they may, for they are all rolling in\\r\\ngold, and won\\'t give her a penny.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMar.  Now, brother, read the newspaper like Counsellor Puff.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, pray do, Mr. Frederick, for I declare I admire you of all things!\\r\\nYou are quite yourself to-night.  Here\\'s a newspaper, sir, pray let us\\r\\nhave Counsellor Puff.  It\\'s not late.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n            [Frederick reads in a pompous voice.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As a delicate white hand has ever been deemed a distinguishing ornament\\r\\nin either sex, Messrs. Valiant and Wise conceive it to be their duty to\\r\\ntake the earliest opportunity to advertise the nobility and gentry of\\r\\nGreat Britain in general, and their friends in particular, that they have\\r\\nnow ready for sale, as usual, at the Hippocrates\\' Head, a fresh\\r\\nassortment of new-invented, much admired, primrose soap.  To prevent\\r\\nimpositions and counterfeits, the public are requested to take notice,\\r\\nthat the only genuine primrose soap is stamped on the outside, \\'Valiant\\r\\nand Wise.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you most incomparable mimic! \\'tis absolutely the counsellor himself.\\r\\nI absolutely must show you, some day, to my friend Lady Battersby; you\\'d\\r\\nabsolutely make her die with laughing; and she\\'d quite adore you,\" said\\r\\nMrs. Theresa, who was well aware that every pause must be filled with\\r\\nflattery.  \"Pray go on, pray go on.  I shall never be tired, if I sit\\r\\nlooking at you these hundred years.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStimulated by these plaudits, Frederick proceeded to show how Colonel\\r\\nEpaulette blew his nose, flourished his cambric handkerchief, bowed to\\r\\nLady Diana Periwinkle, and admired her work, saying, \"Done by no hands,\\r\\nas you may guess, but those of Fairly Fair.\"  Whilst Lady Diana, he\\r\\nobserved, simpered so prettily, and took herself so quietly for Fairly\\r\\nFair, not perceiving that the colonel was admiring his own nails all the\\r\\nwhile.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext to Colonel Epaulette, Frederick, at Marianne\\'s particular desire,\\r\\ncame into the room like Sir Charles Slang.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, brother,\" cried she, \"your hand down to the very bottom of\\r\\nyour pocket, and your other shoulder up to your ear; but you are not\\r\\nquite wooden enough, and you should walk as if your hip were out of\\r\\njoint.  There now, Mrs. Tattle, are not those good eyes?  They stare so\\r\\nlike his, without seeming to see anything all the while.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excellent! admirable! Mr. Frederick.  I must say that you are the best\\r\\nmimic of your age I ever saw, and I\\'m sure Lady Battersby will think so\\r\\ntoo.  That is Sir Charles to the very life.  But with all that, you must\\r\\nknow he\\'s a mighty pleasant, fashionable young man when you come to know\\r\\nhim, and has a great deal of sense under all that, and is of a very good\\r\\nfamily--the Slangs, you know.  Sir Charles will come into a fine fortune\\r\\nhimself next year, if he can keep clear of gambling, which I hear is his\\r\\nfoible, poor young man!  Pray go on.  I interrupt you, Mr. Frederick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, brother,\" said Marianne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Marianne, I can do no more.  I\\'m quite tired, and I will do no\\r\\nmore,\" said Frederick, stretching himself at full length upon a sofa.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven in the midst of laughter, and whilst the voice of flattery yet\\r\\nsounded in his ear, Frederick felt sad, displeased with himself, and\\r\\ndisgusted with Mrs. Theresa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a deep sigh was there!\" said Mrs. Theresa; \"what can make you sigh\\r\\nso bitterly?  You, who make everybody else laugh.  Oh, such another sigh\\r\\nagain!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Marianne,\" cried Frederick, \"do you remember the man in the mask?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What man in the mask, brother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The man--the actor--the buffoon, that my father told us of, who used to\\r\\ncry behind the mask that made everybody else laugh.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cry! bless me,\" said Mrs. Theresa, \"mighty odd! very extraordinary! but\\r\\none can\\'t be surprised at meeting with extraordinary characters amongst\\r\\nthat race of people, actors by profession, you know; for they are brought\\r\\nup from the egg to make their fortune, or at least their bread by their\\r\\noddities.  But, my dear Mr. Frederick, you are quite pale, quite\\r\\nexhausted; no wonder--what will you have? a glass of cowslip-wine?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh no, thank you, ma\\'am,\" said Frederick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh yes; indeed you must not leave me without taking something; and Miss\\r\\nMarianne must have another macaroon.  I insist upon it,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa, ringing the bell.  \"It is not late, and my man Christopher will\\r\\nbring up the cowslip-wine in a minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, Sophy! and papa and mamma, you know, will come home presently,\"\\r\\nsaid Marianne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Miss Sophy has her books and drawings.  You know she\\'s never afraid\\r\\nof being alone.  Besides, to-night it was her own choice.  And as to your\\r\\npapa and mamma, they won\\'t be home to-night, I\\'m pretty sure; for a\\r\\ngentleman, who had it from their own authority, told me where they were\\r\\ngoing, which is further off than they think; but they did not consult me;\\r\\nand I fancy they\\'ll be obliged to sleep out; so you need not be in a\\r\\nhurry about them.  We\\'ll have candles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door opened just as Mrs. Tattle was going to ring the bell again for\\r\\ncandles and the cowslip-wine.  \"Christopher! Christopher!\" said Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa, who was standing at the fire, with her back to the door, when it\\r\\nopened, \"Christopher! pray bring--Do you hear?\" but no Christopher\\r\\nanswered; and, upon turning round, Mrs. Tattle, instead of Christopher,\\r\\nbeheld two little black figures, which stood perfectly still and silent.\\r\\nIt was so dark, that their forms could scarcely be discerned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the name of heaven, who and what may you be?  Speak, I conjure you!\\r\\nwhat are ye?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The chimney-sweepers, ma\\'am, an\\' please your ladyship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Chimney-sweepers!\" repeated Frederick and Marianne, bursting out a-\\r\\nlaughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Chimney-sweepers!\" repeated Mrs. Theresa, provoked at the recollection\\r\\nof her late solemn address to them.  \"Chimney-sweepers! and could not you\\r\\nsay so a little sooner?  Pray, what brings you here, gentlemen, at this\\r\\ntime of night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The bell rang, ma\\'am,\", answered a squeaking voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The bell rang! yes, for Christopher.  The boy\\'s mad, or drunk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ma\\'am,\" said the tallest of the chimney-sweepers, who had not yet\\r\\nspoken, and who now began in a very blunt manner; \"ma\\'am, your brother\\r\\ndesired us to come up when the bell rang; so we did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My brother?  I have no brother, dunce,\" said Mrs. Theresa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Eden, madam.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ho, ho!\" said Mrs. Tattle, in a more complacent tone, \"the boy takes me\\r\\nfor Miss Bertha Eden, I perceive\"; and, flattered to be taken in the dark\\r\\nby a chimney-sweeper for a young and handsome lady, Mrs. Theresa laughed,\\r\\nand informed him \"that they had mistaken the room; and they must go up\\r\\nanother pair of stairs, and turn to the left.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chimney-sweeper with the squeaking voice bowed, thanked her ladyship\\r\\nfor this information, said, \"Good night to ye, quality\"; and they both\\r\\nmoved towards the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stay,\" said Mrs. Tattle, whose curiosity was excited; \"what can the\\r\\nEdens want with chimney-sweepers at this time o\\' night, I wonder?\\r\\nChristopher, did you hear anything about it?\" said the lady to her\\r\\nfootman, who was now lighting the candles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, ma\\'am,\" said the servant, \"I can\\'t say; but I\\'ll step down\\r\\nbelow and inquire.  I heard them talking about it in the kitchen; but I\\r\\nonly got a word here and there, for I was hunting for the snuff-dish, as\\r\\nI knew it must be for candles when I heard the bell ring, ma\\'am; so I\\r\\nthought to find the snuff-dish before I answered the bell, for I knew it\\r\\nmust be for candles you rang.  But, if you please, I\\'ll step down now,\\r\\nma\\'am, and see about the chimney-sweepers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, step down, do; and, Christopher, bring up the cowslip-wine, and\\r\\nsome more macaroons for my little Marianne.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne withdrew rather coldly from a kiss which Mrs. Tattle was going\\r\\nto give her; for she was somewhat surprised at the familiarity with which\\r\\nthis lady talked to her footman.  She had not been accustomed to these\\r\\nfamiliarities in her father and mother, and she did not like them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Tattle to Christopher, who was now returned, \"what is\\r\\nthe news?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ma\\'am, the little fellow with the squeaking voice has been telling me\\r\\nthe whole story.  The other morning, ma\\'am, early, he and the other were\\r\\ndown the hill sweeping in Paradise Row.  Those chimneys, they say, are\\r\\ndifficult; and the square fellow, ma\\'am, the biggest of the two boys, got\\r\\nwedged in the chimney.  The other little fellow was up at the top at the\\r\\ntime, and he heard the cry; but in his fright, and all, he did not know\\r\\nwhat to do, ma\\'am; for he looked about from the top of the chimney, and\\r\\nnot a soul could he see stirring, but a few that he could not make attend\\r\\nto his screech; the boy within almost stifling too.  So he screeched, and\\r\\nscreeched, all he could; and by the greatest chance in life, ma\\'am, old\\r\\nMr. Eden was just going down the hill to fetch his morning walk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay,\" interrupted Mrs. Theresa, \"friend Ephraim is one of your early\\r\\nrisers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Marianne, impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, ma\\'am, hearing the screech, he turns and sees the sweep; and at once\\r\\nhe understands the matter--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sure he must have taken some time to understand it,\" interposed Mrs.\\r\\nTattle, \"for he\\'s the slowest creature breathing, and the deafest in\\r\\ncompany.  Go on, Christopher.  So the sweep did make him hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So he says, ma\\'am; and so the old gentleman went in and pulled the boy\\r\\nout of the chimney, with much ado, ma\\'am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bless me!\" exclaimed Mrs. Theresa; \"but did old Eden go up the chimney\\r\\nhimself after the boy, wig and all?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, ma\\'am,\" said Christopher, with a look of great delight, \"that was\\r\\nall as one, as the very \\'dentical words I put to the boy myself, when he\\r\\ntelled me his story.  But, ma\\'am, that was what I couldn\\'t get out of\\r\\nhim, neither, rightly, for he is a churl--the big boy that was stuck in\\r\\nthe chimney, I mean; for when I put the question to him about the wig,\\r\\nlaughing like, he wouldn\\'t take it laughing like at all; but would only\\r\\nmake answer to us like a bear, \\'He saved my life, that\\'s all I know\\'; and\\r\\nthis over again, ma\\'am, to all the kitchen round, that cross-questioned\\r\\nhim.  But I finds him stupid and ill-mannered like, for I offered him a\\r\\nshilling, ma\\'am, myself, to tell about the wig; but he put it back in a\\r\\nway that did not become such as he, to no lady\\'s butler, ma\\'am; whereupon\\r\\nI turns to the slim fellow (and he\\'s smarterer, and more mannerly, ma\\'am,\\r\\nwith a tongue in his head for his betters), but he could not resolve me\\r\\nmy question either; for he was up at the top of the chimney the best part\\r\\no\\' the time:  and when he came down Mr. Eden had his wig on, but had his\\r\\narm all bare and bloody, ma\\'am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor Mr. Eden!\" exclaimed Marianne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, miss,\" continued the servant, \"and the chimney-sweep himself was so\\r\\nbruised, and must have been killed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well! but he\\'s alive now; go on with your story, Christopher,\"\\r\\nsaid Mrs. T.  \"Chimney-sweepers get wedged in chimneys every day; it\\'s\\r\\npart of their trade, and it\\'s a happy thing when they come off with a few\\r\\nbruises.*  To be sure,\" added she, observing that both Frederick and\\r\\nMarianne looked displeased at this speech, \"to be sure, if one may\\r\\nbelieve this story, there was some real danger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n*This atrocious practice is now happily superseded by the use of sweeping\\r\\nmachines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Real danger! yes, indeed,\" said Marianne; \"and I\\'m sure I think Mr. Eden\\r\\nwas very good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly it was a most commendable action, and quite providential.  So\\r\\nI shall take an opportunity of saying, when I tell the story in all\\r\\ncompanies; and the boy may thank his kind stars, I\\'m sure, to the end of\\r\\nhis days, for such an escape--But pray, Christopher,\" said she,\\r\\npersisting in her conversation with Christopher, who was now laying the\\r\\ncloth for supper, \"pray, which house was it in Paradise Row? where the\\r\\nEagles or the Miss Ropers lodge? or which?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was at my Lady Battersby\\'s, ma\\'am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! ha!\" cried Mrs. Theresa, \"I thought we should get to the bottom of\\r\\nthe affair at last.  This is excellent!  This will make an admirable\\r\\nstory for my Lady Battersby the next time I see her.  These Quakers are\\r\\nso sly!  Old Eden, I know, has long wanted to obtain an introduction into\\r\\nthat house; and a charming charitable expedient hit upon!  My Lady\\r\\nBattersby will enjoy this, of all things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" continued Mrs. Theresa, turning to Frederick, as soon as the\\r\\nservant had left the room, \"now, Mr. Frederick Montague, I have a favour-\\r\\n-such a favour--to ask of you; it\\'s a favour which only you can grant;\\r\\nyou have such talents, and would do the thing so admirably; and my Lady\\r\\nBattersby would quite adore you for it.  She will do me the honour to be\\r\\nhere to spend an evening to-morrow.  I\\'m convinced Mr. and Mrs. Montague\\r\\nwill find themselves obliged to stay out another day, and I so long to\\r\\nshow you off to her ladyship; and your Doctor Carbuncle, and your\\r\\nCounsellor Puff, and your Miss Croker, and all your charming characters.\\r\\nYou must let me introduce you to her ladyship to-morrow evening.  Promise\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, ma\\'am,\" said Frederick, \"I cannot promise you any such thing,\\r\\nindeed.  I am much obliged to you; but indeed I cannot come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not, my dear sir? why not?  You don\\'t think I mean you should\\r\\npromise, if you are certain your papa and mamma will be home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If they do come home, I will ask them about it,\" said Frederick,\\r\\nhesitating; for though he by no means wished to accept the invitation, he\\r\\nhad not yet acquired the necessary power of decidedly saying No.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ask them!\" repeated Mrs. Theresa.  \"My dear sir, at your age, must you\\r\\nask your papa and mamma about such things?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Must! no, ma\\'am,\" said Frederick; \"but I said I would.  I know I need\\r\\nnot, because my father and mother always let me judge for myself almost\\r\\nabout everything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And about this, I am sure,\" cried Marianne.  \"Papa and mamma, you know,\\r\\njust as they were going away, said, \\'If Mrs. Theresa asks you to come, do\\r\\nas you think best\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" said Mrs. Theresa, \"you know it rests with yourselves, if\\r\\nyou may do as you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure I may, madam,\" said Frederick, colouring from that species of\\r\\nemotion which is justly called false shame, and which often conquers real\\r\\nshame; \"to be sure, ma\\'am, I may do as I please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I may make sure of you,\" said Mrs. Theresa; \"for now it would be\\r\\ndownright rudeness to tell a lady you won\\'t do as she pleases.  Mr.\\r\\nFrederick Montague, I\\'m sure, is too wellbred a young gentleman to do so\\r\\nunpolite, so ungallant a thing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jargon of politeness and gallantry is frequently brought by the silly\\r\\nacquaintance of young people to confuse their simple morality and clear\\r\\ngood sense.  A new and unintelligible system is presented to them, in a\\r\\nlanguage foreign to their understanding, and contradictory to their\\r\\nfeelings.  They hesitate between new motives and old principles.  From\\r\\nthe fear of being thought ignorant, they become affected; and from the\\r\\ndread of being thought to be children act like fools.  But all this they\\r\\nfeel only when they are in the company of such people as Mrs. Theresa\\r\\nTattle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ma\\'am,\" Frederick began, \"I don\\'t mean to be rude; but I hope you\\'ll\\r\\nexcuse me from coming to drink tea with you to-morrow, because my father\\r\\nand mother are not acquainted with Lady Battersby, and maybe they might\\r\\nnot like--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care, take care,\" said Mrs. Theresa, laughing at his perplexity:\\r\\n\"you want to get off from obliging me, and you don\\'t know how.  You had\\r\\nvery nearly made a most shocking blunder in putting it all upon poor Lady\\r\\nBattersby.  Now you know it\\'s impossible that Mr. and Mrs. Montague could\\r\\nhave in nature the slightest objection to introducing you to my Lady\\r\\nBattersby at my own house; for, don\\'t you know, that, besides her\\r\\nladyship\\'s many unquestionable qualities, which one need not talk of, she\\r\\nis cousin, but once removed, to the Trotters of Lancashire--your mother\\'s\\r\\ngreat favourites?  And there is not a person at the Wells, I\\'ll venture\\r\\nto say, could be of more advantage to your sister Sophy, in the way of\\r\\npartners, when she comes to go the balls, which it\\'s to be supposed she\\r\\nwill, some time or other; and as you are so good a brother, that\\'s a\\r\\nthing to be looked to, you know.  Besides, as to yourself, there\\'s\\r\\nnothing her ladyship delights in so much as in a good mimic; and she\\'ll\\r\\nquite adore you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t want her to adore me, ma\\'am,\" said Frederick, bluntly; then,\\r\\ncorrecting himself, added, \"I mean for being a mimic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not, my love?  Between friends, can there be any harm in showing\\r\\none\\'s talents?  You that have such talents to show.  She\\'ll keep your\\r\\nsecret, I\\'ll answer for her; and,\" added she, \"you needn\\'t be afraid of\\r\\nher criticism; for, between you and me, she\\'s no great critic; so you\\'ll\\r\\ncome.  Well, thank you, that\\'s settled.  How you have made me beg and\\r\\npray! but you know your own value, I see; as you entertaining people\\r\\nalways do.  One must ask a wit, like a fine singer, so often.  Well, but\\r\\nnow for the favour I was going to ask you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrederick looked surprised; for he thought that the favour of his company\\r\\nwas what she meant:  but she explained herself farther.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As to the old Quaker who lodges above, old Ephraim Eden--my Lady\\r\\nBattersby and I have so much diversion about him.  He is the best\\r\\ncharacter, the oddest creature!  If you were but to see him come into the\\r\\nrooms with those stiff skirts, or walking with his eternal sister Bertha,\\r\\nand his everlasting broad-brimmed hat!  One knows him a mile off!  But\\r\\nthen his voice and way, and altogether, if one could get them to the\\r\\nlife, they\\'d be better than anything on the stage; better even than\\r\\nanything I\\'ve seen to-night; and I think you\\'d make a capital Quaker for\\r\\nmy Lady Battersby; but then the thing is, one can never get to hear the\\r\\nold quiz talk.  Now you, who have so much invention and cleverness--I\\r\\nhave no invention myself; but could you not hit upon some way of seeing\\r\\nhim, so that you might get him by heart?  I\\'m sure you, who are so quick,\\r\\nwould only want to see him, and hear him, for half a minute, to be able\\r\\nto take him off, so as to kill one with laughing.  But I have no\\r\\ninvention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, as to the invention,\" said Frederick, \"I know an admirable way of\\r\\ndoing the thing, if that is all; but then remember, I don\\'t say I will do\\r\\nthe thing, for I will not.  But I know a way of getting up into his room,\\r\\nand seeing him, without his knowing me to be there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, tell it me, you charming, clever creature!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, remember, I do not say I will do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well, let us hear it; and you shall do as you please afterwards.\\r\\nMerciful goodness!\" exclaimed Mrs. Tattle, \"do my ears deceive me?  I\\r\\ndeclare I looked round, and thought I heard the squeaking chimney-sweeper\\r\\nwas in the room!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So did I, Frederick, I declare,\" cried Marianne, laughing, \"I never\\r\\nheard anything so like his voice in my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrederick imitated the squeaking voice of this chimney-sweeper to great\\r\\nperfection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" continued he, \"this fellow is just my height.  The old Quaker, if\\r\\nmy face were blackened, and if I were to change clothes with the chimney-\\r\\nsweeper, I\\'ll answer for it, would never know me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, it\\'s an admirable invention!  I give you infinite credit for it!\"\\r\\nexclaimed Mrs. Theresa.  \"It shall, it must be done.  I\\'ll ring, and have\\r\\nthe fellow up this minute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no; do not ring,\" said Frederick, stopping her hand, \"I don\\'t mean\\r\\nto do it.  You know you promised that I should do as I pleased.  I only\\r\\ntold you my invention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well; but only let me ring, and ask whether the chimney-sweepers\\r\\nare below.  You shall do as you please afterwards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Christopher, shut the door.  Christopher,\" said she to the servant who\\r\\ncame up when she rang, \"pray are the sweeps gone yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, ma\\'am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But have they been up to old Eden yet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, ma\\'am; nor be not to go till the bell rings; for Miss Bertha,\\r\\nma\\'am, was asleep a-lying down, and her brother wouldn\\'t have her wakened\\r\\non no account whatsomever.  He came down hisself to the kitchen to the\\r\\nsweeps, though; but wouldn\\'t have, as I heard him say, his sister waked\\r\\nfor no account.  But Miss Bertha\\'s bell will ring when she wakens for the\\r\\nsweeps, ma\\'am.  \\'Twas she wanted to see the boy as her brother saved, and\\r\\nI suppose sent for him to give him something charitable, ma\\'am.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, never mind your suppositions,\" said Mrs. Theresa; \"run down this\\r\\nvery minute to the little squeaking chimney-sweep, and send him up to me.\\r\\nQuick, but don\\'t let the other bear come up with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChristopher, who had curiosity, as well as his mistress, when he returned\\r\\nwith the chimney-sweeper, prolonged his own stay in the room by sweeping\\r\\nthe hearth, throwing down the tongs and shovel, and picking them up\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will do, Christopher!  Christopher, that will do, I say,\" Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa repeated in vain.  She was obliged to say, \"Christopher, you may\\r\\ngo,\" before he would depart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said she to Frederick, \"step in here to the next room with this\\r\\ncandle, and you\\'ll be equipped in an instant.  Only just change clothes\\r\\nwith the boy; only just let me see what a charming chimney-sweeper you\\'d\\r\\nmake. You shall do as you please afterwards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'ll only change clothes with him, just to show you for one\\r\\nminute.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" said Marianne to Mrs. Theresa whilst Frederick was changing his\\r\\nclothes, \"I think Frederick is right about--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About what, love?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think he is in the right not to go up, though he can do it so easily,\\r\\nto see that gentleman; I mean on purpose to mimic and laugh at him\\r\\nafterwards.  I don\\'t think that would be quite right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, pray, Miss Marianne?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, because he is so good-natured to his sister.  He would not let her\\r\\nbe wakened.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear, it\\'s easy to be good in such little things; and he won\\'t have long\\r\\nto be good to her neither; for I don\\'t think she will trouble him long in\\r\\nthis world, anyhow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\" said Marianne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That she\\'ll die, child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Die! die with that beautiful colour in her cheeks!  How sorry her poor,\\r\\npoor brother will be!  But she will not die, I\\'m sure, for she walks\\r\\nabout and runs upstairs so lightly!  Oh, you must be quite mistaken, I\\r\\nhope.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I\\'m mistaken, Dr. Panado Cardamum\\'s mistaken too, then, that\\'s my\\r\\ncomfort.  He says, unless the waters work a miracle, she stands a bad\\r\\nchance; and she won\\'t follow my advice, and consult the doctor for her\\r\\nhealth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He would frighten her to death, perhaps,\" said Marianne.  \"I hope\\r\\nFrederick won\\'t go up to disturb her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lud, child, you are turned simpleton all of a sudden; how can your\\r\\nbrother disturb her more than the real chimney-sweeper?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t think it\\'s right,\" persisted Marianne, \"and I shall tell him\\r\\nso.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, Miss Marianne, I don\\'t commend you now.  Young ladies should not be\\r\\nso forward to give opinions and advice to their elder brothers unasked;\\r\\nand I presume that Mr. Frederick and I must know what\\'s right as well as\\r\\nMiss Marianne.  Hush! here he is.  Oh, the capital figure!\" cried Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa.  \"Bravo, bravo!\" cried she, as Frederick entered in the chimney-\\r\\nsweeper\\'s dress; and as he spoke, saying, \"I\\'m afraid, please your\\r\\nladyship, to dirt your ladyship\\'s carpet,\" she broke out into immoderate\\r\\nraptures, calling him \"her charming chimney-sweeper!\" and repeating that\\r\\nshe knew beforehand the character would do for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Theresa instantly rang the bell, in spite of all expostulation--\\r\\nordered Christopher to send up the other chimney-sweeper--triumphed in\\r\\nobserving that Christopher did not know Frederick when he came into the\\r\\nroom; and offered to lay any wager that the other chimney-sweeper would\\r\\nmistake him for his companion.  And so he did; and when Frederick spoke,\\r\\nthe voice was so very like, that it was scarcely possible that he should\\r\\nhave perceived the difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne was diverted by this scene; but she started, when in the midst\\r\\nof it they heard a bell ring.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the lady\\'s bell, and we must go,\" said the blunt chimney-sweeper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go, then, about your business,\" said Mrs. Theresa, \"and here\\'s a\\r\\nshilling for you, to drink, my honest fellow.  I did not know you were so\\r\\nmuch bruised when I first saw you.  I won\\'t detain you.  Go,\" said she,\\r\\npushing Frederick towards the door.  Marianne sprang forward to speak to\\r\\nhim; but Mrs. Theresa kept her off; and, though Frederick resisted, the\\r\\nlady shut the door upon him by superior force, and, having locked it,\\r\\nthere was no retreat.  Mrs. Tattle and Marianne waited impatiently for\\r\\nFrederick\\'s return.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hear them,\" cried Marianne, \"I hear them coming downstairs.\"  They\\r\\nlistened again, and all was silent.  At length they suddenly heard a\\r\\ngreat noise of many steps in the hall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Merciful!\" exclaimed Mrs. Theresa, \"it must be your father and mother\\r\\ncome back.\"  Marianne ran to unlock the room door, and Mrs. Theresa\\r\\nfollowed her into the hall.  The hall was rather dark, but under the lamp\\r\\na crowd of people, all the servants in the house having gathered\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Mrs. Theresa approached, the crowd opened in silence, and in the midst\\r\\nshe beheld Frederick, with blood streaming from his face.  His head was\\r\\nheld by Christopher; and the chimney-sweeper was holding a basin for him.\\r\\n\"Merciful! what will become of me?\" exclaimed Mrs. Theresa.  \"Bleeding!\\r\\nhe\\'ll bleed to death!  Can nobody think of anything that will stop blood\\r\\nin a minute?  A key, a large key down his back--a key--has nobody a key?\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Montague will be here before he has done bleeding.  A key!\\r\\ncobwebs! a puff ball! for mercy\\'s sake! Can nobody think of anything that\\r\\nwill stop blood in a minute?  Gracious me! he\\'ll bleed to death, I\\r\\nbelieve.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'ll bleed to death!  Oh, my brother!\" cried Marianne, catching hold of\\r\\nthe words; and terrified, she ran upstairs, crying, \"Sophy, oh, Sophy!\\r\\ncome down this minute, or he\\'ll be dead!  My brother\\'s bleeding to death!\\r\\nSophy! Sophy! come down, or he\\'ll be dead!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let go the basin, you,\" said Christopher, pulling the basin out of the\\r\\nchimney-sweeper\\'s hand, who had all this time stood in silence; \"you are\\r\\nnot fit to hold the basin for a gentleman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let him hold it,\" said Frederick; \"he did not mean to hurt me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s more than he deserves.  I\\'m certain sure he might have known well\\r\\nenough it was Mr. Frederick all the time, and he\\'d no business to go to\\r\\nfight--such a one as he--with a gentleman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know he was a gentleman!\" said the chimney-sweeper, \"how could\\r\\nI?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How could he, indeed!\" said Frederick; \"he shall hold the basin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gracious me!  I\\'m glad to hear him speak like himself again, at\\r\\nanyrate,\" cried Mrs. Theresa.  \"And here comes Miss Sophy, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sophy!\" cried Frederick.  \"Oh, Sophy, don\\'t you come--don\\'t look at me;\\r\\nyou\\'ll despise me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My brother! where? where?\" said Sophy, looking, as she thought, at the\\r\\ntwo chimney-sweepers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s Frederick,\" said Marianne:  \"that\\'s my brother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Sophy, don\\'t be alarmed,\" Mrs. Theresa began; \"but gracious\\r\\ngoodness!  I wish Miss Bertha--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant a female figure in white appeared upon the stairs; she\\r\\npassed swiftly on, whilst everyone gave way before her.  \"Oh, Miss\\r\\nBertha!\" cried Mrs. Theresa, catching hold of her gown to stop her, as\\r\\nshe came near Frederick.  \"Oh, Miss Eden, your beautiful India muslin!\\r\\ntake care of the chimney sweeper, for heaven\\'s sake.\"  But she pressed\\r\\nforward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s my brother, will he die?\" cried Marianne, throwing her arms round\\r\\nher, and looking up as if to a being of a superior order.  \"Will he bleed\\r\\nto death?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my love!\" answered a sweet voice:  \"do not frighten thyself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve done bleeding,\" said Frederick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear me, Miss Marianne, if you would not make such a rout,\" cried Mrs.\\r\\nTattle.  \"Miss Bertha, it\\'s nothing but a frolic.  You see Mr. Frederick\\r\\nMontague only in a masquerade dress.  Nothing in the world but a frolic,\\r\\nma\\'am.  You see he\\'s stopped bleeding.  I was frightened out of my wits\\r\\nat first.  I thought it was his eye, but I see it\\'s only his nose.  All\\'s\\r\\nwell that ends well.  Mr. Frederick, we\\'ll keep your counsel.  Pray,\\r\\nma\\'am, let us ask no questions; it\\'s only a boyish frolic.  Come, Mr.\\r\\nFrederick, this way, into my room, and I\\'ll give you a towel and some\\r\\nclean water, and you can get rid of this masquerade dress.  Make haste,\\r\\nfor fear your father and mother should drop in upon us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not be afraid of thy father and mother.  They are surely thy best\\r\\nfriends,\" said a voice.  It was the voice of an elderly gentleman, who\\r\\nnow stood behind Frederick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, sir, oh, Mr. Eden,\" said Frederick, turning to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t betray me! for goodness\\' sake!\" whispered Mrs. Tattle, \"say\\r\\nnothing about me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m not thinking about you.  Let me speak,\" cried he, pushing away her\\r\\nhand, which stopped his mouth.  \"I shall say nothing about you, I promise\\r\\nyou,\" said Frederick, with a look of contempt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, but for your own sake, my dear sir, your papa and mamma.  Bless me!\\r\\nis not that Mrs. Montague\\'s carriage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My brother, ma\\'am,\" said Sophy, \"is not afraid of my father and mother\\'s\\r\\ncoming back.  Let him speak; he was going to speak the truth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure, Miss Sophia, I wouldn\\'t hinder him from speaking the truth;\\r\\nbut it\\'s not proper, I presume, ma\\'am, to speak truth at all times, and\\r\\nin all places, and before everybody, servants and all.  I only wanted,\\r\\nma\\'am, to hinder your brother from exposing himself.  A hall, I\\r\\napprehend, is not a proper place for explanation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here,\" said Mr. Eden, opening the door of his room, which was on the\\r\\nopposite side of the hall to Mrs. Tattle\\'s.  \"Here is a place,\" said he\\r\\nto Frederick, \"where thou mayst speak the truth at all times, and before\\r\\neverybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, my room\\'s at Mr. Frederick Montague\\'s service, and my door\\'s open\\r\\ntoo.  This way, pray,\" said she, pulling his arm.  But Frederick broke\\r\\nfrom her, and followed Mr. Eden.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, sir, will you forgive me?\" cried he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Forgive thee!--and what have I to forgive!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Forgive, brother, without asking what,\" said Bertha, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He shall know all!\" cried Frederick; \"all that concerns myself, I mean.\\r\\nSir, I disguised myself in this dress; I came up to your room to-night on\\r\\npurpose to see you, without your knowing it, that I might mimic you.  The\\r\\nchimney-sweeper, where is he?\" said Frederick, looking round; and he ran\\r\\ninto the hall to see for him.  \"May he come in? he may--he is a brave, an\\r\\nhonest, good, grateful boy.  He never guessed who I was.  After we left\\r\\nyou we went down to the kitchen together, and there, fool as I was, for\\r\\nthe pleasure of making Mr. Christopher and the servants laugh, began to\\r\\nmimic you.  This boy said he would not stand by and hear you laughed at;\\r\\nthat you had saved his life; that I ought to be ashamed of myself; that\\r\\nyou had just given me half a crown; and so you had; but I went on, and\\r\\ntold him I\\'d knock him down if he said another word.  He did; I gave the\\r\\nfirst blow; we fought; I came to the ground; the servants pulled me up\\r\\nagain.  They found out, I don\\'t know how, that I was not a chimney-\\r\\nsweeper.  The rest you saw.  And now can you forgive me, sir?\" said\\r\\nFrederick to Mr. Eden, seizing hold of his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The other hand, friend,\" said the Quaker, gently withdrawing his right\\r\\nhand, which everybody now observed was much swelled, and putting it into\\r\\nhis bosom again.  \"This, and welcome,\" offering his other hand to\\r\\nFrederick, and shaking his with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that other hand!\" said Frederick, \"that was hurt, I remember.  How\\r\\nill I have behaved--extremely ill!  But this is a lesson that I shall\\r\\nnever forget as long as I live.  I hope for the future I shall behave\\r\\nlike a gentleman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And like a man--and like a good man, I am sure thou wilt,\" said the good\\r\\nQuaker, shaking Frederick\\'s hand affectionately; \"or I am much mistaken,\\r\\nfriend, in that black countenance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are not mistaken,\" cried Marianne.  \"Frederick will never be\\r\\npersuaded again by anybody to do what he does not think right:  and now,\\r\\nbrother, you may wash your black countenance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJust when Frederick had got rid of half his black countenance, a double\\r\\nknock was heard at the door.  It was Mr. and Mrs. Montague.  \"What will\\r\\nyou do now?\" whispered Mrs. Theresa to Frederick, as his father and\\r\\nmother came into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A chimney-sweeper covered with blood!\" exclaimed Mr. and Mrs. Montague.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Father, I am Frederick,\" said he, stepping forward towards them, as they\\r\\nstood in astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Frederick! my son!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, mother, I\\'m not hurt half so much as I deserve; I\\'ll tell you--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay,\" interrupted Bertha, \"let my brother tell the story this time.\\r\\nThou hast told it once, and told it well; no one but my brother could\\r\\ntell it better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A story never tells so well the second time, to be sure,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nTheresa; \"but Mr. Eden will certainly make the best of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout taking any notice of Mrs. Tattle, or her apprehensive looks, Mr.\\r\\nEden explained all he knew of the affair in a few words.  \"Your son,\"\\r\\nconcluded he, \"will quickly put off his dirty dress.  The dress hath not\\r\\nstained the mind; that is fair and honourable.  When he found himself in\\r\\nthe wrong, he said so; nor was he in haste to conceal his adventure from\\r\\nhis father; this made me think well of both father and son.  I speak\\r\\nplainly, friend, for that is best.  But what is become of the other\\r\\nchimney-sweeper?  He will want to go home,\" said Mr. Eden, turning to\\r\\nMrs. Theresa.  Without making any reply, she hurried out of the room as\\r\\nfast as possible, and returned in a few moments, with a look of extreme\\r\\nconsternation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is a catastrophe indeed!  Now, indeed, Mr. Frederick, your papa and\\r\\nmamma have reason to be angry.  A new suit of clothes!--the bare faced\\r\\nvillain! gone! no sign of them in my closet, or anywhere.  The door was\\r\\nlocked; he must have gone up the chimney, out upon the leads, and so\\r\\nescaped; but Christopher is after him.  I protest, Mrs. Montague, you\\r\\ntake it too quietly.  The wretch!--a new suit of clothes, blue coat and\\r\\nbuff waistcoat.  I never heard of such a thing!  I declare, Mr. Montague,\\r\\nyou are vastly good, not to be in a passion,\" added Mrs. Theresa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Madam,\" replied Mr. Montague, with a look of much civil contempt, \"I\\r\\nthink the loss of a suit of clothes, and even the disgrace that my son\\r\\nhas been brought to this evening, fortunate circumstances in his\\r\\neducation.  He will, I am persuaded, judge and act for himself more\\r\\nwisely in future.  Nor will he be tempted to offend against humanity, for\\r\\nthe sake of being called \\'The best mimic in the world.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BARRING OUT; OR, PARTY SPIRIT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The mother of mischief,\" says an old proverb, \"is no bigger than a\\r\\nmidge\\'s wing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Doctor Middleton\\'s school, there was a great tall dunce of the name of\\r\\nFisher, who never could be taught how to look out a word in the\\r\\ndictionary.  He used to torment everybody with--\"Do pray help me!  I\\r\\ncan\\'t make out this one word.\"  The person who usually helped him in his\\r\\ndistress was a very clever, good natured boy, of the name of De Grey, who\\r\\nhad been many years under Dr. Middleton\\'s care, and who, by his abilities\\r\\nand good conduct, did him great credit.  The doctor certainly was both\\r\\nproud and fond of him; but he was so well beloved, or so much esteemed by\\r\\nhis companions, that nobody had ever called him by the odious name of\\r\\nfavourite, until the arrival of a new scholar of the name of Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\nTill Archer came, the ideas of FAVOURITES and PARTIES were almost unknown\\r\\nat Dr. Middleton\\'s; but he brought all these ideas fresh from a great\\r\\npublic school, at which he had been educated--at which he had acquired a\\r\\nsufficient quantity of Greek and Latin, and a superabundant quantity of\\r\\nparty spirit.  His aim, the moment he came to a new school, was to get to\\r\\nthe head of it, or at least to form the strongest party.  His influence,\\r\\nfor he was a boy of considerable abilities, was quickly felt, though he\\r\\nhad a powerful rival, as he thought proper to call him, in De Grey; and,\\r\\nwith HIM, a rival was always an enemy.  De Grey, so far from giving him\\r\\nany cause of hatred, treated him with a degree of cordiality, which would\\r\\nprobably have had an effect upon Archer\\'s mind, if it had not been for\\r\\nthe artifices of Fisher.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may seem surprising, that a GREAT DUNCE should be able to work upon a\\r\\nboy like an Archer, who was called a great genius; but when genius is\\r\\njoined to a violent temper, instead of being united to good sense, it is\\r\\nat the mercy even of dunces.\\r\\n\\r\\nFisher was mortally offended one morning by De Grey\\'s refusing to\\r\\ntranslate his whole lesson for him.  He went over to Archer, who,\\r\\nconsidering him as a partisan deserting from the enemy, received him with\\r\\nopen arms, and translated his whole lesson without expressing MUCH\\r\\ncontempt for his stupidity.  From this moment Fisher forgot all De Grey\\'s\\r\\nformer kindness, and considered only how he could in his turn mortify the\\r\\nperson whom he felt to be so much his superior.\\r\\n\\r\\nDe Grey and Archer were now reading for a premium, which was to be given\\r\\nin their class.  Fisher betted on Archer\\'s head, who had not sense enough\\r\\nto despise the bet of a blockhead.  On the contrary he suffered him to\\r\\nexcite the spirit of rivalship in its utmost fury by collecting the bets\\r\\nof all the school.  So that this premium now became a matter of the\\r\\ngreatest consequence, and Archer, instead of taking the means to secure a\\r\\njudgment in his favour, was listening to the opinions of all his\\r\\ncompanions.  It was a prize which was to be won by his own exertions; but\\r\\nhe suffered himself to consider it as an affair of chance.  The\\r\\nconsequence was, that he trusted to chance--his partisans lost their\\r\\nwagers, and he the premium--and his temper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Archer,\" said Dr. Middleton, after the grand affair was decided,\\r\\n\"you have done all that genius alone could do; but you, De Grey, have\\r\\ndone all that genius and industry united could do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well!\" cried Archer, with affected gaiety, as soon as the doctor had\\r\\nleft the room--\"Well, I\\'m content with MY sentence.  Genius alone! for\\r\\nme--industry for those who WANT it,\" added he, with a significant look at\\r\\nDe Grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nFisher applauded this as a very spirited speech; and, by insinuations\\r\\nthat Dr. Middleton \"always gave the premium to De Grey,\" and that \"those\\r\\nwho had lost their bets might thank themselves for it, for being such\\r\\nsimpletons as to bet against the favourite,\" he raised a murmur highly\\r\\nflattering to Archer, amongst some of the most credulous boys; whilst\\r\\nothers loudly proclaimed their belief in Dr. Middleton\\'s impartiality.\\r\\nThese warmly congratulated De Grey.  At this Archer grew more and more\\r\\nangry, and when Fisher was proceeding to speak nonsense FOR him, pushed\\r\\nforward into the circle to De Grey, crying, \"I wish, Mr. Fisher, you\\r\\nwould let me fight my own battles!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And _I_ wish,\" said young Townsend, who was fonder of diversions than of\\r\\npremiums, or battles, or of anything else--\"_I_ wish, that we were not to\\r\\nhave any battles; after having worked like horses, don\\'t set about to\\r\\nfight like dogs.  Come,\" said he, tapping De Grey\\'s shoulder, \"let us see\\r\\nyour new playhouse, do--it\\'s a holiday, and let us make the most of it.\\r\\nLet us have the \\'School for Scandal,\\' do; and I\\'ll play Charles for you,\\r\\nand you, De Grey, shall be MY LITTLE PREMIUM.  Come, do open this new\\r\\nplayhouse of yours to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come then!\" said De Grey, and he ran across the playground to a waste\\r\\nbuilding at the farthest end of it, in which, at the earnest request of\\r\\nthe whole community, and with the permission of Dr. Middleton, he had\\r\\nwith much pain and ingenuity erected a theatre.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The new theatre is going to be opened!  Follow the manager!  Follow the\\r\\nmanager!\" echoed a multitude of voices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"FOLLOW THE MANAGER!\" echoed very disagreeably in Archer\\'s ear; but as he\\r\\ncould not be LEFT ALONE, he was also obliged to follow the manager.  The\\r\\nmoment that the door was unlocked, the crowd rushed in:  the delight and\\r\\nwonder expressed at the sight was great, and the applause and thanks\\r\\nwhich were bestowed upon the manager were long and loud.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher at least thought them long, for he was impatient till his voice\\r\\ncould be heard.  When at length the acclamations had spent themselves, he\\r\\nwalked across the stage with a knowing air, and looking round\\r\\ncontemptuously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is THIS your famous playhouse?\" cried he.  \"I wish you had, any of\\r\\nyou, seen the playhouse _I_ have been used to?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words made a great and visible change in the feelings and opinions\\r\\nof the public.  \"Who would be a servant of the public? or who would toil\\r\\nfor popular applause?\"  A few words spoken in a decisive tone by a new\\r\\nvoice operated as a charm, and the playhouse was in an instant\\r\\nmetamorphosed in the eyes of the spectators.  All gratitude for the past\\r\\nwas forgotten, and the expectation of something better justified to the\\r\\ncapricious multitude their disdain of what they had so lately pronounced\\r\\nto be excellent.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone now began to criticise.  One observed, \"that the green curtain\\r\\nwas full of holes, and would not draw up.\"  Another attacked the scenes;\\r\\n\"Scenes! they were not like real scenes--Archer must know best, because\\r\\nhe was used to these things.\"  So everybody crowded to hear something of\\r\\nthe OTHER playhouse.  They gathered round Archer to hear the description\\r\\nof his playhouse, and at every sentence insulting comparisons were made.\\r\\nWhen he had done, his auditors looked round, sighed and wished that\\r\\nArcher had been their manager.  They turned from De Grey as from a person\\r\\nwho had done them an injury.  Some of his friends--for he had friends who\\r\\nwere not swayed by the popular opinion--felt indignation at this\\r\\ningratitude, and were going to express their feelings; but De Grey\\r\\nstopped them, and begged that he might speak for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, coming forward, as soon as he felt that he had\\r\\nsufficient command of himself.  \"My friends, I see you are discontented\\r\\nwith me and my playhouse.  I have done my best to please you; but if\\r\\nanybody else can please you better, I shall be glad of it.  I did not\\r\\nwork so hard for the glory of being your manager.  You have my free leave\\r\\nto tear down--\"  Here his voice faltered, but he hurried on--\"You have my\\r\\nfree leave to tear down all my work as fast as you please.  Archer, shake\\r\\nhands first, however, to show that there\\'s no malice in the case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher, who was touched by what his rival said, and, stopping the hand of\\r\\nhis new partisan, Fisher, cried, \"No, Fisher! no!--no pulling down.  We\\r\\ncan alter it.  There is a great deal of ingenuity in it, considering.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain Archer would now have recalled the public to reason,--the time\\r\\nfor reason was passed:  enthusiasm had taken hold of their minds.  \"Down\\r\\nwith it!  Down with it!  Archer for ever!\" cried Fisher, and tore down\\r\\nthe curtain.  The riot once begun, nothing could stop the little mob,\\r\\ntill the whole theatre was demolished.  The love of power prevailed in\\r\\nthe mind of Archer; he was secretly flattered by the zeal of his PARTY,\\r\\nand he mistook their love of mischief for attachment to himself.  De Grey\\r\\nlooked on superior.  \"I said I could bear to see all this, and I can,\"\\r\\nsaid he; \"now it is all over.\"  And now it was all over, there was\\r\\nsilence.  The rioters stood still to take breath, and to look at what\\r\\nthey had done.  There was a blank space before them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this moment of silence there was heard something like a voice.  \"Hush!\\r\\nWhat strange voice is that?\" said Archer.  Fisher caught fast hold of his\\r\\narm.  Everybody looked round to see where the voice came from.  It was\\r\\ndusk.  Two window-shutters at the farthest end of the building were seen\\r\\nto move slowly inwards.  De Grey, and in the same instant Archer, went\\r\\nforward; and, as the shutters opened, there appeared through the hole the\\r\\ndark face and shrivelled hands of a very old gipsy.  She did not speak;\\r\\nbut she looked first at one and then at another.  At length she fixed her\\r\\neyes on De Grey.  \"Well, woman,\" said he, \"what do you want with me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Want!--nothing--with YOU,\" said the old woman; \"do you want nothing with\\r\\nME?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing,\" said De Grey.  Her eye immediately turned upon Archer,--\"YOU\\r\\nwant something with me,\" said she, with emphasis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--what do I want?\" replied Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said she, changing her tone, \"you want nothing--nothing will you\\r\\never want, or I am much mistaken in that FACE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that WATCH-CHAIN, she should have said, for her quick eye had espied\\r\\nArcher\\'s watch-chain.  He was the only person in the company who had a\\r\\nwatch, and she therefore judged him to be the richest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had you ever your fortune told, sir, in your life?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I!\" said he, looking at De Grey, as if he was afraid of his\\r\\nridicule, if he listened to the gipsy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not you!  No! for you will make your own fortune, and the fortune of all\\r\\nthat belong to you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s good news for my friends!\" cried Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I\\'m one of them, remember that,\" cried Fisher.  \"And I,\" \"And I,\"\\r\\njoined a number of voices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good luck to them!\" cried the gipsy, \"good luck to them all!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, as soon as they had acquired sufficient confidence in her good\\r\\nwill, they pressed up to the window.  \"There,\" cried Townsend, as he\\r\\nchanced to stumble over the carpenter\\'s mitre box, which stood in the\\r\\nway, \"there\\'s a good omen for me.  I\\'ve stumbled on the mitre box; I\\r\\nshall certainly be a bishop.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHappy he who had sixpence, for he bid fair to be a judge upon the bench.\\r\\nAnd happier he who had a shilling, for he was in the high road to be one\\r\\nday upon the woolsack, Lord High Chancellor of England.  No one had half\\r\\na crown, or no one would surely have kept it in his pocket upon such an\\r\\noccasion, for he might have been an archbishop, a king, or what he\\r\\npleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nFisher, who like all weak people was extremely credulous, kept his post\\r\\nimmovable in the front row all the time, his mouth open, and his stupid\\r\\neyes fixed upon the gipsy, in whom he felt implicit faith.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who have least confidence in their own powers, and who have least\\r\\nexpectation from the success of their own exertions, are always most\\r\\ndisposed to trust in fortune-tellers and fortune.  They hope to WIN, when\\r\\nthey cannot EARN; and as they can never be convinced by those who speak\\r\\nsense, it is no wonder they are always persuaded by those who talk\\r\\nnonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a question to put,\" said Fisher, in a solemn tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Put it, then,\" said Archer, \"what hinders you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But they will hear me,\" said he, looking suspiciously at De Grey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_I_ shall not hear you,\" said De Grey, \"I am going.\"  Everybody else\\r\\ndrew back, and left him to whisper his question in the gipsy\\'s ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is become of my Livy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your SISTER Livy, do you mean?\" said the gipsy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my LATIN Livy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gipsy paused for information.  \"It had a leaf torn out in the\\r\\nbeginning, and I HATE DR. MIDDLETON--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Written in it,\" interrupted the gipsy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Right--the very book!\" cried Fisher with joy.  \"But how COULD you know\\r\\nit was Dr. Middleton\\'s name?  I thought I had scratched it, so that\\r\\nnobody could make it out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nobody COULD make it out but ME,\" replied the gipsy.  \"But never think\\r\\nto deceive me,\" said she, shaking her head at him in a manner that made\\r\\nhim tremble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t deceive you indeed, I tell you the whole truth.  I lost it a\\r\\nweek ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And when shall I find it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Meet me here at this hour to-morrow evening, and I will answer you.  No\\r\\nmore!  I must be gone.  Not a word more to-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe pulled the shutters towards her, and left the youth in darkness.  All\\r\\nhis companions were gone.  He had been so deeply engaged in this\\r\\nconference, that he had not perceived their departure.  He found all the\\r\\nworld at supper, but no entreaties could prevail upon him to disclose his\\r\\nsecret.  Townsend rallied in vain.  As for Archer, he was not disposed to\\r\\ndestroy by ridicule the effect which he saw that the old woman\\'s\\r\\npredictions in his favour had had upon the imagination of many of his\\r\\nlittle partisans.  He had privately slipped two good shillings into the\\r\\ngipsy\\'s hand to secure her; for he was willing to pay any price for ANY\\r\\nmeans of acquiring power.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe watch-chain had not deceived the gipsy, for Archer was the richest\\r\\nperson in the community.  His friends had imprudently supplied him with\\r\\nmore money than is usually trusted to boys of his age.  Dr. Middleton had\\r\\nrefused to give him a larger monthly allowance than the rest of his\\r\\ncompanions; but he brought to school with him secretly the sum of five\\r\\nguineas.  This appeared to his friends and to himself an inexhaustible\\r\\ntreasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiches and talents would, he flattered himself, secure to him that\\r\\nascendancy of which he was so ambitious.  \"Am I your manager, or not?\"\\r\\nwas now his question.  \"I scorn to take advantage of a hasty moment; but\\r\\nsince last night you have had time to consider.  If you desire me to be\\r\\nyour manager, you shall see what a theatre I will make for you.  In this\\r\\npurse,\" said he, showing through the network a glimpse of the shining\\r\\ntreasure--\"in this purse is Aladdin\\'s wonderful lamp.  Am I your manager?\\r\\nPut it to the vote.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was put to the vote.  About ten of the most reasonable of the assembly\\r\\ndeclared their gratitude and high approbation of their old friend, De\\r\\nGrey; but the numbers were in favour of the new friend.  And as no\\r\\nmetaphysical distinctions relative to the idea of a majority had ever\\r\\nentered their thoughts, the most numerous party considered themselves as\\r\\nnow beyond dispute in the right.  They drew off on one side in triumph,\\r\\nand their leader, who knew the consequence of a name in party matters,\\r\\nimmediately distinguished his partisans by the gallant name of ARCHERS,\\r\\nstigmatizing the friends of De Grey by the odious epithet of Greybeards.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst the Archers was a class not very remarkable for their mental\\r\\nqualifications; but who, by their bodily activity, and by the peculiar\\r\\nadvantages annexed to their way of life, rendered themselves of the\\r\\nhighest consequence, especially to the rich and enterprising.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe judicious reader will apprehend that I allude to the persons called\\r\\nday scholars.  Amongst these, Fisher was distinguished by his knowledge\\r\\nof all the streets and shops in the adjacent town; and, though a dull\\r\\nscholar, he had such reputation as a man of business, that whoever had\\r\\ncommissions to execute at the confectioner\\'s, was sure to apply to him.\\r\\nSome of the youngest of his employers had, it is true, at times\\r\\ncomplained that he made mistakes of halfpence and pence in their\\r\\naccounts; but as these affairs could never be brought to a public trial,\\r\\nFisher\\'s character and consequence were undiminished, till the fatal day\\r\\nwhen his Aunt Barbara forbade his visits to the confectioner\\'s; or,\\r\\nrather, till she requested the confectioner, who had his private reasons\\r\\nfor obeying her, not TO RECEIVE her nephew\\'s visits, as he had made\\r\\nhimself sick at his house, and Mrs. Barbara\\'s fears for his health were\\r\\nincessant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough his visits to the confectioner\\'s were thus at an end, there were\\r\\nmany other shops open to him; and with officious zeal he offered his\\r\\nservices to the new manager, to purchase whatever might be wanting for\\r\\nthe theatre.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince his father\\'s death Fisher had become a boarder at Dr. Middleton\\'s,\\r\\nbut his frequent visits to his Aunt Barbara afforded him opportunities of\\r\\ngoing into the town.  The carpenter, De Grey\\'s friend, was discarded by\\r\\nArcher, for having said \"LACK-A-DAISY!\" when he saw that the old theatre\\r\\nwas pulled down.  A new carpenter and paper hanger, recommended by\\r\\nFisher, were appointed to attend, with their tools, for orders, at two\\r\\no\\'clock.  Archer, impatient to show his ingenuity and his generosity,\\r\\ngave his plan and his orders in a few minutes, in a most decided manner;\\r\\n\"These things,\" he observed, \"should be done with some spirit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo which the carpenter readily assented, and added, that \"gentlemen of\\r\\nspirit never looked to the EXPENSE, but always to the EFFECT.\"  Upon this\\r\\nprinciple Mr. Chip set to work with all possible alacrity.  In a few\\r\\nhours\\' time he promised to produce a grand effect.  High expectations\\r\\nwere formed.  Nothing was talked of but the new playhouse; and so intent\\r\\nupon it was every head, that no lessons could be got.  Archer was\\r\\nobliged, in the midst of his various occupations, to perform the part of\\r\\ngrammar and dictionary for twenty different people.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O ye Athenians!\" he exclaimed, \"how hard do I work to obtain your\\r\\npraise!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nImpatient to return to the theatre, the moment the hours destined for\\r\\ninstruction, or, as they are termed by schoolboys, school-hours, were\\r\\nover, each prisoner started up with a shout of joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop one moment, gentlemen, if you please,\" said Dr. Middleton, in an\\r\\nawful voice.  \"Mr. Archer, return to your place.  Are you all here?\"  The\\r\\nnames of all the boys were called over, and when each had answered to his\\r\\nname, Dr. Middleton said--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gentlemen, I am sorry to interrupt your amusements; but, till you have\\r\\ncontrary orders from me, no one, on pain of my serious displeasure, must\\r\\ngo into THAT building\" (pointing to the place where the theatre was\\r\\nerecting).  \"Mr. Archer, your carpenter is at the door.  You will be so\\r\\ngood as to dismiss him.  I do not think proper to give my reasons for\\r\\nthese orders; but you who KNOW me,\" said the doctor, and his eye turned\\r\\ntowards De Grey, \"will not suspect me of caprice.  I depend, gentlemen,\\r\\nupon your obedience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the dead silence with which these orders were received, succeeded in a\\r\\nfew minutes a universal groan.  \"So!\" said Townsend, \"all our diversion\\r\\nis over.\"  \"So,\" whispered Fisher in the manager\\'s ear, \"this is some\\r\\ntrick of the Greybeard\\'s.  Did you not observe how he looked at De Grey?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFired by this thought, which had never entered his mind before, Archer\\r\\nstarted from his reverie, and striking his hand upon the table, swore\\r\\nthat he \"would not be outwitted by any Greybeard in Europe--no, nor by\\r\\nall of them put together.  The Archers were surely a match for them.  He\\r\\nwould stand by them, if they would stand by him,\" he declared, with a\\r\\nloud voice, \"against the whole world, and Dr. Middleton himself, with\\r\\n\\'LITTLE PREMIUMS\\' at his right hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody admired Archer\\'s spirit, but were a little appalled at the\\r\\nsound of standing against Dr. Middleton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not?\" resumed the indignant manager.  \"Neither Dr. Middleton nor any\\r\\ndoctor upon earth shall treat me with injustice.  This, you see, is a\\r\\nstroke at me and my party, and I won\\'t bear it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you are mistaken!\" said De Grey, who was the only one who dared to\\r\\noppose reason to the angry orator.  \"It cannot be a stroke aimed at \\'you\\r\\nand your party,\\' for he does not know that you HAVE a party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll make him know it, and I\\'ll make YOU know it, too,\" said Archer.\\r\\n\"Before I came here you reigned alone, now your reign is over, Mr. De\\r\\nGrey.  Remember my majority this morning, and your theatre last night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has remembered it,\" said Fisher.  \"You see, the moment he was not to\\r\\nbe our manager, we were to have no theatre, no playhouse, no plays.  We\\r\\nmust all sit down with our hands before us--all for \\'GOOD REASONS\\' of Dr.\\r\\nMiddleton\\'s, which he does not vouchsafe to tell us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I won\\'t be governed by any man\\'s reasons that he won\\'t tell me,\" cried\\r\\nArcher.  \"He cannot have good reasons, or why not tell them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nonsense!\" said De Grey.  \"WE SHALL NOT SUSPECT HIM OF CAPRICE!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because we who know him, have never known him capricious.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps not.  _I_ know nothing about him,\" said Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said De Grey; \"for that very reason _I_ speak who do know him.\\r\\nDon\\'t be in a passion, Archer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will be in a passion.  I won\\'t submit to tyranny.  I won\\'t be made a\\r\\nfool of by a few soft words.  You don\\'t know me, De Grey.  I\\'ll go\\r\\nthrough with what I\\'ve begun.  I am manager, and I will be manager; and\\r\\nyou shall see my theatre finished in spite of you, and MY party\\r\\ntriumphant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Party,\" repeated De Grey.  \"I cannot imagine what is in the word \\'party\\'\\r\\nthat seems to drive you mad.  We never heard of parties till you came\\r\\namongst us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; before I came, I say, nobody dared oppose you; but I dare; and I\\r\\ntell you to your face, take care of me--a warm friend and a bitter enemy\\r\\nis my motto.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not your enemy!  I believe you are out of your senses, Archer!\"\\r\\nsaid he, laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Out of my senses!  No; you are my enemy!  Are you not my rival?  Did not\\r\\nyou win the premium?  Did not you want to be manager?  Answer me, are not\\r\\nyou, in one word, a Greybeard?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You called me a Greybeard, but my name is De Grey,\" said he, still\\r\\nlaughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Laugh on!\" cried the other, furiously.  \"Come, ARCHERS, follow me.  WE\\r\\nshall laugh by-and-by, I promise you.\"  At the door Archer was stopped by\\r\\nMr. Chip.  \"Oh, Mr. Chip, I am ordered to discharge you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir; and here\\'s a little bill--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bill, Mr. Chip! why, you have not been at work for two hours!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not much over, sir; but if you\\'ll please to look into it, you\\'ll see\\r\\n\\'tis for a few things you ordered.  The stuff is all laid out and\\r\\ndelivered.  The paper and the festoon-bordering for the drawing room\\r\\nscene is cut out, and left yAnder within.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YAnder, within!  I wish you had not been in such a confounded hurry--\\r\\nsix-and-twenty shillings!\" cried he; \"but I can\\'t stay to talk about it\\r\\nnow.  I\\'ll tell you, Mr. Chip,\" said Archer, lowering his voice, \"what\\r\\nyou must do for me, my good fellow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, drawing Mr. Chip aside, he begged him to pull down some of the wood\\r\\nwork which had been put up, and to cut it into a certain number of wooden\\r\\nbars, of which he gave him the dimensions, with orders to place them all,\\r\\nwhen ready, under a haystack, which he pointed out.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Chip scrupled and hesitated, and began to talk of \"THE DOCTOR.\"\\r\\nArcher immediately began to talk of the bill, and throwing down a guinea\\r\\nand a half, the conscientious carpenter pocketed the money directly, and\\r\\nmade his bow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Master Archer,\" said he, \"there\\'s no refusing you nothing.  You\\r\\nhave such a way of talking one out of it.  You manage me just like a\\r\\nchild.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, ay!\" said Archer, knowing that he had been cheated, and yet proud of\\r\\nmanaging a carpenter, \"ay, ay!  I know the way to manage everybody.  Let\\r\\nthe things be ready in an hour\\'s time, and hark\\'e! leave your tools by\\r\\nmistake behind you, and a thousand of twenty-penny nails.  Ask no\\r\\nquestions, and keep your own counsel like a wise man.  Off with you, and\\r\\ntake care of \\'THE DOCTOR.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Archers, Archers, to the Archers\\' tree!  Follow your leader,\" cried he,\\r\\nsounding his well known whistle as a signal.  His followers gathered\\r\\nround him, and he, raising himself upon the mount at the foot of the\\r\\ntree, counted his numbers, and then, in a voice lower than usual,\\r\\naddressed them thus:--\"My friends, is there a Greybeard amongst us?  If\\r\\nthere is, let him walk off at once, he has my free leave.\"  No one\\r\\nstirred.  \"Then we are all Archers, and we will stand by one another.\\r\\nJoin hands, my friends.\"  They all joined hands.  \"Promise me not to\\r\\nbetray me, and I will go on.  I ask no security but your honour.\"  They\\r\\nall gave their honour to be secret and FAITHFUL, as he called it, and he\\r\\nwent on.  \"Did you ever hear of such a thing as a \\'BARRING OUT,\\' my\\r\\nfriends?\"  They had heard of such a thing, but they had only heard of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher gave the history of a \"Barring Out,\" in which he had been\\r\\nconcerned at his school, in which the boys stood out against the master,\\r\\nand gained their point at last, which was a week\\'s more holidays at\\r\\nEaster.*  \"But if WE should not succeed,\" said they, \"Dr.  Middleton is\\r\\nso steady; he never goes back from what he has said.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you ever try to push him back?  Let us be steady and he\\'ll tremble.\\r\\nTyrants always tremble when--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" interrupted a number of voices; \"but he is not a tyrant--is he?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All schoolmasters are tyrants--are not they?\" replied Archer; \"and is\\r\\nnot he a schoolmaster?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this logic there was no answer; but, still reluctant, they asked,\\r\\n\"What they should GET by a Barring Out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get!--everything!--what we want!--which is everything to lads of spirit-\\r\\n-victory and liberty!  Bar him out till he repeals his tyrannical law;\\r\\ntill he lets us into our own theatre again, or till he tells us his \\'GOOD\\r\\nREASONS\\' against it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But perhaps he has reasons for not telling us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impossible!\" cried Archer, \"that\\'s the way we are always to be governed\\r\\nby a man in a wig, who says he has good reasons, and can\\'t tell them.\\r\\nAre you fools?  Go! go back to De Grey!  I see you are all Greybeards.\\r\\nGo!  Who goes first?\"  Nobody would go FIRST.  \"I will have nothing to do\\r\\nwith ye, if ye are resolved to be slaves!\"  \"We won\\'t be slaves!\" they\\r\\nall exclaimed at once.  \"Then,\" said Archer, \"stand out in the right and\\r\\nbe free.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n*[This custom of \"BARRING OUT\" was very general (especially in the\\r\\nnorthern parts of England) during the 17th and 18th centuries, and it has\\r\\nbeen fully described by Brand and other antiquarian writers.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Johnson mentions that Addison, while under the tuition of Mr. Shaw,\\r\\nmaster of the Lichfield Grammar School, led, and successfully conducted,\\r\\n\"a plan for BARRING OUT his master.  A disorderly privilege,\" says the\\r\\ndoctor, \"which, in his time, prevailed in the principal seminaries of\\r\\neducation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Gentleman\\'s Magazine of 1828, Dr. P. A. Nuttall, under the\\r\\nsignature of II. A. N., has given a spirited sketch of a \"BARRING OUT\" at\\r\\nthe Ormskirk Grammar School, which has since been republished at length\\r\\n(though without acknowledgment), by Sir Henry Ellis, in Bohn\\'s recent\\r\\nedition of Brand\\'s \"Popular Antiquities.\"  This operation took place\\r\\nearly in the present century, and is interesting from its being, perhaps,\\r\\nthe last attempt on record, and also from the circumstance of the writer\\r\\nhimself having been one of the juvenile leaders in the daring adventure,\\r\\n\"quo rum pars magna fuit,\"--Ed.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THE RIGHT.\"  It would have taken up too much time to examine what \"THE\\r\\nRIGHT\" was.  Archer was always sure that \"THE RIGHT\" was what his party\\r\\nchose to do; that is, what he chose to do himself; and such is the\\r\\ninfluence of numbers upon each other, in conquering the feelings of shame\\r\\nand in confusing the powers of reasoning, that in a few minutes \"the\\r\\nright\" was forgotten, and each said to himself, \"To be sure, Archer is a\\r\\nvery clever boy, and he can\\'t be mistaken\"; or, \"to be sure, Townsend\\r\\nthinks so, and he would not do anything to get us into a scrape\"; or, \"to\\r\\nbe sure, everybody will agree to this but myself, and I can\\'t stand out\\r\\nalone, to be pointed at as a Greybeard and a slave.  Everybody thinks it\\r\\nis right, and everybody can\\'t be wrong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy some of these arguments, which passed rapidly through the mind without\\r\\nhis being conscious of them, each boy decided, and deceived himself--what\\r\\nnone would have done alone, none scrupled to do as a party.  It was\\r\\ndetermined, then, that there should be a Barring Out.  The arrangement of\\r\\nthe affair was left to their new manager, to whom they all pledged\\r\\nimplicit obedience.  Obedience, it seems, is necessary, even from rebels\\r\\nto their ringleaders; not reasonable, but implicit obedience.\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely had the assembly adjourned to the Ball-alley, when Fisher, with\\r\\nan important length of face, came up to the manager, and desired to speak\\r\\none word to him.  \"My advice to you, Archer, is, to do nothing in this\\r\\ntill we have consulted, YOU KNOW WHO, about whether it\\'s right or wrong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'YOU KNOW WHO!\\'  Whom do you mean?  Make haste, and don\\'t make so many\\r\\nfaces, for I\\'m in a hurry.  Who is \\'YOU KNOW WHO?\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The old woman,\" said Fisher, gravely; \"the gipsy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may consult the old woman,\" said Archer, bursting out a-laughing,\\r\\n\"about what\\'s right and wrong, if you please; but no old woman shall\\r\\ndecide for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; but you don\\'t TAKE me,\" said Fisher; \"you don\\'t TAKE me.  By right\\r\\nand wrong, I mean lucky and unlucky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever _I_ do will be lucky,\" replied Archer.  \"My gipsy told you that\\r\\nalready.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know, I know,\" said Fisher, \"and what she said about your friends\\r\\nbeing lucky--that went a great way with many,\" added he, with a sagacious\\r\\nnod of his head; \"I can tell you THAT--more than you think.  Do you\\r\\nknow,\" said he, laying hold of Archer\\'s button, \"I\\'m in the secret.\\r\\nThere are nine of us have crooked our little fingers upon it, not to stir\\r\\na step till we get her advice; and she has appointed me to meet her about\\r\\nparticular business of my own at eight.  So I\\'m to consult her and to\\r\\nbring her answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher knew too well how to govern fools, to attempt to reason with them;\\r\\nand, instead of laughing any longer at Fisher\\'s ridiculous superstition,\\r\\nhe was determined to take advantage of it.  He affected to be persuaded\\r\\nof the wisdom of the measure; looked at his watch; urged him to be exact\\r\\nto a moment; conjured him to remember exactly the words of the oracle;\\r\\nand, above all things, to demand the lucky hour and minute when the\\r\\nBarring Out should begin.  With these instructions Archer put his watch\\r\\ninto the solemn dupe\\'s hand, and left him to count the seconds, till the\\r\\nmoment of his appointment, whilst he ran off himself to prepare the\\r\\noracle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a little gate which looked into a lane, through which he guessed that\\r\\nthe gipsy must pass, he stationed himself, saw her, gave her half a crown\\r\\nand her instructions, made his escape, and got back unsuspected to\\r\\nFisher, whom he found in the attitude in which he had left him, watching\\r\\nthe motion of the minute hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nProud of his secret commission, Fisher slouched his hat, he knew not why,\\r\\nover his face, and proceeded towards the appointed spot.  To keep, as he\\r\\nhad been charged by Archer, within the letter of the law, he stood BEHIND\\r\\nthe forbidden building, and waited some minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough a gap in the hedge the old woman at length made her appearance,\\r\\nmuffled up, and looking cautiously about her.  \"There\\'s nobody near us!\"\\r\\nsaid Fisher, and he began to be a little afraid.  \"What answer,\" said he,\\r\\nrecollecting himself, \"about my Livy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lost! lost! lost!\" said the gipsy, lifting up her hands; \"never, never,\\r\\nnever to be found!  But no matter for that now; that is not your errand\\r\\nto-night; no tricks with me; speak to me of what is next your heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFisher, astonished, put his hand upon his heart, told her all that she\\r\\nknew before, and received the answers that Archer had dictated:  \"That\\r\\nthe Archers should be lucky as long as they stuck to their manager, and\\r\\nto one another; that the Barring Out should end in woe, if not begun\\r\\nprecisely as the clock should strike nine on Wednesday night; but if\\r\\nbegun in that LUCKY moment, and all obedient to their LUCKY leader, all\\r\\nshould end well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA thought, a provident thought, now struck Fisher; for even he had some\\r\\nforesight where his favourite passion was concerned.  \"Pray, in our\\r\\nBarring Out shall we be starved?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said the gipsy, \"not if you trust to me for food, and if you give\\r\\nme money enough.  Silver won\\'t do for so many; gold is what must cross my\\r\\nhand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no gold,\" said Fisher, \"and I don\\'t know what you mean by \\'so\\r\\nmany.\\'  I\\'m only talking of number one, you know.  I must take care of\\r\\nthat first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, as Fisher thought it was possible that Archer, clever as he was,\\r\\nmight be disappointed in his supplies, he determined to take secret\\r\\nmeasures for himself.  His Aunt Barbara\\'s interdiction had shut him out\\r\\nof the confectioner\\'s shop; but he flattered himself that he could outwit\\r\\nhis aunt; he therefore begged the gipsy to procure him twelve buns by\\r\\nThursday morning, and bring them secretly to one of the windows of the\\r\\nschoolroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Fisher did not produce any money when he made this proposal, it was at\\r\\nfirst absolutely rejected; but a bribe at length conquered his\\r\\ndifficulties; and the bribe which Fisher found himself obliged to give--\\r\\nfor he had no pocket money left of his own, he being as much RESTRICTED\\r\\nin that article as Archer was INDULGED--the bribe that he found himself\\r\\nobliged to give to quiet the gipsy was half a crown, which Archer had\\r\\nintrusted to him to buy candles for the theatre.  \"Oh,\" thought he to\\r\\nhimself; \"Archer\\'s so careless about money, he will never think of asking\\r\\nme for the half-crown again; and now he\\'ll want no candles for the\\r\\nTHEATRE; or, at anyrate, it will be some time first; and maybe, Aunt\\r\\nBarbara may be got to give me that much at Christmas; then, if the worst\\r\\ncomes to the worst, one can pay Archer.  My mouth waters for the buns,\\r\\nand have \\'em I must now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, for the hope of twelve buns, he sacrificed the money which had been\\r\\nintrusted to him.  Thus the meanest motives, in mean minds often prompt\\r\\nto the commission of those great faults, to which one should think\\r\\nnothing but some violent passion could have tempted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ambassador having thus, in his opinion, concluded his own and the\\r\\npublic business, returned well satisfied with the result, after receiving\\r\\nthe gipsy\\'s reiterated promise to tap THREE TIMES at the window on\\r\\nThursday morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day appointed for the Barring Out at length arrived; and Archer,\\r\\nassembling the confederates, informed them, that all was prepared for\\r\\ncarrying their design into execution; that he now depended for success\\r\\nupon their punctuality and courage.  He had, within the last two hours,\\r\\ngot all their bars ready to fasten the doors and window shutters of the\\r\\nschoolroom; he had, with the assistance of two of the day scholars who\\r\\nwere of the party, sent into the town for provisions, at his own expense,\\r\\nwhich would make a handsome supper for that night; he had also negotiated\\r\\nwith some cousins of his, who lived in the town, for a constant supply in\\r\\nfuture.  \"Bless me,\" exclaimed Archer, suddenly stopping in this\\r\\nnarration of his services, \"there\\'s one thing, after all, I\\'ve forgot, we\\r\\nshall be undone without it.  Fisher, pray did you ever buy the candles\\r\\nfor the playhouse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, to be sure,\" replied Fisher, extremely frightened; \"you know you\\r\\ndon\\'t want candles for the playhouse now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not for the playhouse, but for the Barring Out.  We shall be in the\\r\\ndark, man.  You must run this minute, run.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For candles?\" said Fisher, confused; \"how many?--what sort?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stupidity!\" exclaimed Archer, \"you are a pretty fellow at a dead lift!\\r\\nLend me a pencil and a bit of paper, do; I\\'ll write down what I want\\r\\nmyself!  Well, what are you fumbling for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For money!\" said Fisher, colouring.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Money, man!  Didn\\'t I give you half a crown the other day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied Fisher, stammering; \"but I wasn\\'t sure that that might be\\r\\nenough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Enough! yes, to be sure it will.  I don\\'t know what you are AT.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" said Fisher, \"here, write upon this, then,\" said\\r\\nFisher, putting a piece of paper into Archer\\'s hand, upon which Archer\\r\\nwrote his orders.  \"Away, away!\" cried he.\\r\\n\\r\\nAway went Fisher.  He returned; but not until a considerable time\\r\\nafterwards.  They were at supper when he returned.  \"Fisher always comes\\r\\nin at supper-time,\" observed one of the Greybeards, carelessly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and would you have him come in AFTER supper-time?\" said Townsend,\\r\\nwho always supplied his party with ready wit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got the candles,\" whispered Fisher as he passed by Archer to his\\r\\nplace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the tinder-box?\" said Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; I got back from my Aunt Barbara under pretence that I must study\\r\\nfor repetition day an hour later to-night.  So I got leave.  Was not that\\r\\nclever?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA dunce always thinks it clever to cheat even by SOBER LIES.  How Mr.\\r\\nFisher procured the candles and the tinder box without money, and without\\r\\ncredit, we shall discover further on.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher and his associates had agreed to stay the last in the schoolroom;\\r\\nand as soon as the Greybeards were gone out to bed, he, as the signal,\\r\\nwas to shut and lock one door, Townsend the other.  A third conspirator\\r\\nwas to strike a light, in case they should not be able to secure a\\r\\ncandle.  A fourth was to take charge of the candle as soon as lighted;\\r\\nand all the rest were to run to their bars, which were secreted in a\\r\\nroom; then to fix them to the common fastening bars of the window, in the\\r\\nmanner in which they had been previously instructed by the manager.  Thus\\r\\neach had his part assigned, and each was warned that the success of the\\r\\nwhole depended upon their order and punctuality.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrder and punctuality, it appears, are necessary even in a Barring Out;\\r\\nand even rebellion must have its laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long expected moment at length arrived.  De Grey and his friends,\\r\\nunconscious of what was going forward, walked out of the schoolroom as\\r\\nusual at bedtime.  The clock began to strike nine.  There was one\\r\\nGreybeard left in the room, who was packing up some of his books, which\\r\\nhad been left about by accident.  It is impossible to describe the\\r\\nimpatience with which he was watched, especially by Fisher, and the nine\\r\\nwho depended upon the gipsy oracle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had got all his books together under his arm, he let one of them\\r\\nfall; and whilst he stooped to pick it up, Archer gave the signal.  The\\r\\ndoors were shut, locked, and double-locked in an instant.  A light was\\r\\nstruck and each ran to his post.  The bars were all in the same moment\\r\\nput up to the windows, and Archer, when he had tried them all, and seen\\r\\nthat they were secure, gave a loud \"Huzza!\"--in which he was joined by\\r\\nall the party most manfully--by all but the poor Greybeard, who, the\\r\\npicture of astonishment, stood stock still in the midst of them with his\\r\\nbooks under his arm; at which spectacle Townsend, who enjoyed the FROLIC\\r\\nof the fray more than anything else, burst into an immoderate fit of\\r\\nlaughter.  \"So, my little Greybeard,\" said he, holding a candle full in\\r\\nhis eyes, \"what think you of all this?--How came you amongst the wicked\\r\\nones?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know, indeed,\" said the little boy, very gravely:  \"you shut me\\r\\nup amongst you.  Won\\'t you let me out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let you out!  No, no, my little Greybeard,\" said Archer, catching hold\\r\\nof him, and dragging him to the window bars.  \"Look ye here--touch these-\\r\\n-put your hand to them--pull, push, kick--put a little spirit into it,\\r\\nman--kick like an Archer, if you can; away with ye.  It\\'s a pity that the\\r\\nking of the Greybeards is not here to admire me.  I should like to show\\r\\nhim our fortifications.  But come, my merry men all, now to the feast.\\r\\nOut with the table into the middle of the room.  Good cheer, my jolly\\r\\nArchers!  I\\'m your manager!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTownsend, delighted with the bustle, rubbed his hands, and capered about\\r\\nthe room, whilst the preparations for the feast were hurried forward.\\r\\n\"Four candles!--Four candles on the table.  Let\\'s have things in style\\r\\nwhen we are about it, Mr. Manager,\" cried Townsend.  \"Places!--Places!\\r\\nThere\\'s nothing like a fair scramble, my boys.  Let everyone take care of\\r\\nhimself.  Hallo! Greybeard, I\\'ve knocked Greybeard down here in the\\r\\nscuffle.  Get up again, my lad, and see a little life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" cried Fisher, \"he sha\\'n\\'t SUP with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" cried the manager, \"he shan\\'t LIVE with us; a Greybeard is not\\r\\nfit company for Archers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" cried Townsend, \"evil communication corrupts good manners.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo with one unanimous hiss they hunted the poor little gentle boy into a\\r\\ncorner; and having pent him up with benches, Fisher opened his books for\\r\\nhim, which he thought the greatest mortification, and set up a candle\\r\\nbeside him--\"There, now he looks like a Greybeard as he is!\" cried they.\\r\\n\"Tell me what\\'s the Latin for cold roast beef?\" said Fisher, exultingly,\\r\\nand they returned to their feast.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong and loud they revelled.  They had a few bottles of cider.  \"Give me\\r\\nthe corkscrew, the cider sha\\'n\\'t be kept till it\\'s sour,\" cried Townsend,\\r\\nin answer to the manager, who, when he beheld the provisions vanishing\\r\\nwith surprising rapidity, began to fear for the morrow.  \"Hang to-\\r\\nmorrow!\" cried Townsend, \"let Greybeards think of to-morrow; Mr. Manager,\\r\\nhere\\'s your good health.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Archers all stood up as their cups were filled to drink the health of\\r\\ntheir chief with a universal cheer.  But at the moment that the cups were\\r\\nat their lips, and as Archer bowed to thank the company, a sudden shower\\r\\nfrom above astonished the whole assembly.  They looked up, and beheld the\\r\\nrose of a watering-engine, whose long neck appeared through a trap door\\r\\nin the ceiling.  \"Your good health, Mr. Manager!\" said a voice, which was\\r\\nknown to be the gardener\\'s; and in the midst of their surprise and dismay\\r\\nthe candles were suddenly extinguished; the trap-door shut down; and they\\r\\nwere left in utter darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The DEVIL!\" said Archer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t swear, Mr. Manager,\" said the same voice from the ceiling, \"I hear\\r\\nevery word you say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mercy upon us!\" exclaimed Fisher.  \"The clock,\" added he, whispering,\\r\\n\"must have been wrong, for it had not done striking when we began.  Only,\\r\\nyou remember, Archer, it had just done before you had done locking your\\r\\ndoor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hold your tongue, blockhead!\" said Archer.  \"Well, boys! were ye never\\r\\nin the dark before?  You are not afraid of a shower of rain, I hope.  Is\\r\\nanybody drowned?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said they, with a faint laugh, \"but what shall we do here in the\\r\\ndark all night long, and all day to-morrow?  We can\\'t unbar the\\r\\nshutters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a wonder NOBODY ever thought of the trap-door!\" said Townsend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trap-door had indeed escaped the manager\\'s observation.  As the house\\r\\nwas new to him, and the ceiling being newly white-washed, the opening was\\r\\nscarcely perceptible.  Vexed to be out-generalled, and still more vexed\\r\\nto have it remarked, Archer poured forth a volley of incoherent\\r\\nexclamations and reproaches against those who were thus so soon\\r\\ndiscouraged by a trifle; and groping for the tinder-box, he asked if\\r\\nanything could be easier than to strike a light again.*  The light\\r\\nappeared.  But at the moment that it made the tinder-box visible, another\\r\\nshower from above, aimed, and aimed exactly, at the tinder-box, drenched\\r\\nit with water, and rendered it totally unfit for further service.  Archer\\r\\nin a fury dashed it to the ground.  And now for the first time he felt\\r\\nwhat it was to be the unsuccessful head of a party.  He heard in his turn\\r\\nthe murmurs of a discontented, changeable populace; and recollecting all\\r\\nhis bars and bolts, and ingenious contrivances, he was more provoked at\\r\\ntheir blaming him for this one only oversight than he was grieved at the\\r\\ndisaster itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Lucifer matches were then unknown.--Ed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my hair is all wet!\" cried one, dolefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wring it, then,\" said Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My hand\\'s cut with your broken glass,\" cried another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Glass!\" cried a third; \"mercy! is there broken glass? and it\\'s all\\r\\nabout, I suppose, amongst the supper; and I had but one bit of bread all\\r\\nthe time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bread!\" cried Archer; \"eat if you want it.  Here\\'s a piece here, and no\\r\\nglass near it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s all wet, and I don\\'t like dry bread by itself; that\\'s no feast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Heigh-day!  What, nothing but moaning and grumbling!  If these are the\\r\\njoys of a Barring Out,\" cried Townsend, \"I\\'d rather be snug in my bed.  I\\r\\nexpected that we should have sat up till twelve o\\'clock, talking, and\\r\\nlaughing, and singing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So you may still; what hinders you?\" said Archer.  \"Sing, and we\\'ll join\\r\\nyou, and I should be glad those fellows overhead heard us singing.\\r\\nBegin, Townsend--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"\\'Come now, all ye social Powers,\\r\\n       Spread your influence o\\'er us\\'--\\r\\n\\r\\nOr else--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"\\'Rule, Britannia! Britannia rules the waves!\\r\\n       Britons never will be slaves.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing can be more melancholy than forced merriment.  In vain they\\r\\nroared in chorus.  In vain they tried to appear gay.  It would not do.\\r\\nThe voices died away, and dropped off one by one.  They had each provided\\r\\nhimself with a great-coat to sleep upon; but now, in the dark, there was\\r\\na peevish scrambling contest for the coats, and half the company, in very\\r\\nbad humour, stretched themselves upon the benches for the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is great pleasure in bearing anything that has the appearance of\\r\\nhardship as long as there is any glory to be acquired by it:  but when\\r\\npeople feel themselves foiled, there is no further pleasure in endurance;\\r\\nand if, in their misfortune, there is any mixture of the ridiculous, the\\r\\nmotives for heroism are immediately destroyed.  Dr.  Middleton had\\r\\nprobably considered this in the choice he made of his first attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher, who had spent the night as a man who had the cares of government\\r\\nupon his shoulders, rose early in the morning, whilst everybody else was\\r\\nfast asleep.  In the night he had resolved the affair of the trap-door,\\r\\nand a new danger had alarmed him.  It was possible that the enemy might\\r\\ndescend upon them through the trap-door.  The room had been built high to\\r\\nadmit a free circulation of air.  It was twenty feet, so that it was in\\r\\nvain to think of reaching to the trap-door.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the daylight appeared, Archer rose softly, that he might\\r\\nRECONNOITRE, and devise some method of guarding against this new danger.\\r\\nLuckily there were round holes in the top of the window-shutters, which\\r\\nadmitted sufficient light for him to work by.  The remains of the soaked\\r\\nfeast, wet candles, and broken glass spread over the table in the middle\\r\\nof the room, looked rather dismal this morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'A pretty set of fellows I have to manage!\" said Archer, contemplating\\r\\nthe group of sleepers before him.  \"It is well they have somebody to\\r\\nthink for them.  Now if I wanted--which, thank goodness, I don\\'t--but if\\r\\nI did want to call a cabinet council to my assistance, whom could I pitch\\r\\nupon? not this stupid snorer, who is dreaming of gipsies, if he is\\r\\ndreaming of anything,\" continued Archer, as he looked into Fisher\\'s open\\r\\nmouth.  \"This next chap is quick enough; but, then, he is so fond of\\r\\nhaving everything his own way.  And this curl pated monkey, who is\\r\\ngrinning in his sleep, is all tongue and no brains.  Here are brains,\\r\\nthough nobody would think it, in this lump,\" said he, looking at a fat,\\r\\nrolled up, heavy breathing sleeper; \"but what signify brains to such a\\r\\nlazy dog?  I might kick him for my football this half hour before I\\r\\nshould get him awake.  This lank jawed harlequin beside him is a handy\\r\\nfellow, to be sure; but, then, if he has hands, he has no head--and he\\'d\\r\\nbe afraid of his own shadow too, by this light, he is such a coward!  And\\r\\nTownsend, why, he has puns in plenty; but, when there\\'s any work to be\\r\\ndone, he\\'s the worst fellow to be near one in the world--he can do\\r\\nnothing but laugh at his own puns.  This poor little fellow that we\\r\\nhunted into the corner has more sense than all of them put together; but\\r\\nthen he is a Greybeard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus speculated the chief of a party upon his sleeping friends.  And how\\r\\ndid it happen that he should be so ambitious to please and govern this\\r\\nset, when, for each individual of which it was composed, he felt such\\r\\nsupreme contempt?  He had formed them into a PARTY, had given them a\\r\\nname, and he was at their head.  If these be not good reasons, none\\r\\nbetter can be assigned for Archer\\'s conduct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish ye could all sleep on,\" said he; \"but I must waken ye, though you\\r\\nwill be only in my way.  The sound of my hammering must waken them; so I\\r\\nmay as well do the thing handsomely, and flatter some of them by\\r\\npretending to ask their advice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly, he pulled two or three to waken them.  \"Come, Townsend,\\r\\nwaken, my boy!  Here\\'s some diversion for you--up! up!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Diversion!\" cried Townsend; \"I\\'m your man!  I\\'m up--UP TO ANYTHING.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, under the name of DIVERSION, Archer set Townsend to work at four\\r\\no\\'clock in the morning.  They had nails, a few tools, and several spars,\\r\\nstill left from the wreck of the playhouse.  These, by Archer\\'s\\r\\ndirections, they sharpened at one end, and nailed them to the ends of\\r\\nseveral forms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll hands were now called to clear away the supper things, to erect these\\r\\nforms perpendicularly under the trap-door; and with the assistance of a\\r\\nfew braces, a chevaux-de-frise was formed, upon which nobody could\\r\\nventure to descend.  At the farthest end of the room they likewise formed\\r\\na penthouse of the tables, under which they proposed to breakfast, secure\\r\\nfrom the pelting storm, if it should again assail them through the trap-\\r\\ndoor.  They crowded under the penthouse as soon as it was ready, and\\r\\ntheir admiration of its ingenuity paid the workmen for the job.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord! I shall like to see the gardener\\'s phiz through the trap-door,\\r\\nwhen he beholds the spikes under him!\" cried Townsend.  \"Now for\\r\\nbreakfast!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, now for breakfast,\" said Archer, looking at his watch; \"past eight\\r\\no\\'clock, and my town boys not come!  I don\\'t understand this!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher had expected a constant supply of provisions from two boys who\\r\\nlived in the town, who were cousins of his, and who had promised to come\\r\\nevery day, and put food in at a certain hole in the wall, in which a\\r\\nventilator usually turned.  This ventilator Archer had taken down, and\\r\\nhad contrived it so that it could be easily removed and replaced at\\r\\npleasure; but, upon examination, it was now perceived that the hole had\\r\\nbeen newly stopped up by an iron back, which it was impossible to\\r\\npenetrate or remove.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It never came into my head that anybody would ever have thought of the\\r\\nventilator but myself!\" exclaimed Archer, in great perplexity.  He\\r\\nlistened and waited for his cousins; but no cousins came, and at a late\\r\\nhour the company were obliged to breakfast upon the scattered fragments\\r\\nof the last night\\'s feast.  That feast had been spread with such\\r\\nimprudent profusion, that little now remained to satisfy the hungry\\r\\nguests.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher, who well knew the effect which the apprehension of a scarcity\\r\\nwould have upon his associates, did everything that could be done by a\\r\\nbold countenance and reiterated assertions to persuade them that his\\r\\ncousins would certainly come at last and that the supplies were only\\r\\ndelayed.  The delay, however, was alarming.\\r\\n\\r\\nFisher alone heard the manager\\'s calculations and saw the public fears\\r\\nunmoved.  Secretly rejoicing in his own wisdom, he walked from window to\\r\\nwindow, slily listening for the gipsy\\'s signal.  \"There it is!\" cried he\\r\\nwith more joy sparkling in his eyes than had ever enlightened them\\r\\nbefore.  \"Come this way, Archer; but don\\'t tell anybody.  Hark! do ye\\r\\nhear those three taps at the window?  This is the old woman with twelve\\r\\nbuns for me.  I\\'ll give you one whole one for yourself, if you will unbar\\r\\nthe window for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unbar the window!\" interrupted Archer; \"no, that I won\\'t, for you or the\\r\\ngipsy either; but I have heard enough to get your buns without that.  But\\r\\nstay; there is something of more consequence than your twelve buns.  I\\r\\nmust think for ye all, I see, regularly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he summoned a council, and proposed that everyone should subscribe,\\r\\nand trust the subscription to the gipsy, to purchase a fresh supply of\\r\\nprovisions.  Archer laid down a guinea of his own money for his\\r\\nsubscription; at which sight all the company clapped their hands, and his\\r\\npopularity rose to a high pitch with their renewed hopes of plenty.  Now,\\r\\nhaving made a list of their wants, they folded the money in the paper,\\r\\nput it into a bag, which Archer tied to a long string, and, having broken\\r\\nthe pane of glass behind the round hole in the window-shutter, he let\\r\\ndown the bag to the gipsy.  She promised to be punctual, and having\\r\\nfilled the bag with Fisher\\'s twelve buns, they were drawn up in triumph,\\r\\nand everybody anticipated the pleasure with which they should see the\\r\\nsame bag drawn up at dinner-time.  The buns were a little squeezed in\\r\\nbeing drawn through the hole in the window-shutter; but Archer\\r\\nimmediately sawed out a piece of the shutter, and broke the corresponding\\r\\npanes in each of the other windows, to prevent suspicion, and to make it\\r\\nappear that they had all been broken to admit air.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a pity that so much ingenuity should have been employed to no\\r\\npurpose!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may have surprised the intelligent reader that the gipsy was so\\r\\npunctual to her promise to Fisher, but we must recollect that her\\r\\napparent integrity was only cunning; she was punctual that she might be\\r\\nemployed again, that she might be intrusted with the contribution which,\\r\\nshe foresaw, must be raised amongst the famishing garrison.  No sooner\\r\\nhad she received the money than her end was gained.\\r\\n\\r\\nDinner-time came; it struck three, four, five, six.  They listened with\\r\\nhungry ears, but no signal was heard.  The morning had been very long,\\r\\nand Archer had in vain tried to dissuade them from devouring the\\r\\nremainder of the provisions before they were sure of a fresh supply.  And\\r\\nnow those who had been the most confident were the most impatient of\\r\\ntheir disappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher, in the division of the food, had attempted, by the most\\r\\nscrupulous exactness, to content the public, and he was both astonished\\r\\nand provoked to perceive that his impartiality was impeached.  So\\r\\ndifferently do people judge in different situations!  He was the first\\r\\nperson to accuse his master of injustice, and the least capable of\\r\\nbearing such an imputation upon himself from others.  He now experienced\\r\\nsome of the joys of power, and the delight of managing unreasonable\\r\\nnumbers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have not I done everything I could to please you?  Have not I spent my\\r\\nmoney to buy you food?  Have not I divided the last morsel with you?  I\\r\\nhave not tasted one mouthful today!  Did not I set to work for you at\\r\\nsunrise?  Did not I lie awake all night for you?  Have not I had all the\\r\\nlabour, and all the anxiety?  Look round and see MY contrivances, MY\\r\\nwork, MY generosity!  And, after all, you think me a tyrant, because I\\r\\nwant you to have common sense.  Is not this bun which I hold in my hand\\r\\nmy own?  Did not I earn it by my own ingenuity from that selfish dunce\"\\r\\n(pointing to Fisher), \"who could never have gotten one of his twelve\\r\\nbuns, if I had not shown him how?  Eleven of them he has eaten since\\r\\nmorning for his own share, without offering anyone a morsel; but I scorn\\r\\nto eat even what is justly my own, when I see so many hungry creatures\\r\\nlonging for it.  I was not going to touch this last morsel myself.  I\\r\\nonly begged you to keep it till supper-time, when perhaps you\\'ll want it\\r\\nmore, and Townsend, who can\\'t bear the slightest thing that crosses his\\r\\nown whims, and who thinks there\\'s nothing in this world to be minded but\\r\\nhis own diversion, calls me a TYRANT.  You all of you promised to obey\\r\\nme.  The first thing I ask you to do for your own good, and when, if you\\r\\nhad common sense, you must know I can want nothing but your good, you\\r\\nrebel against me.  Traitors! fools! ungrateful fools!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher walked up and down, unable to command his emotion, whilst, for the\\r\\nmoment, the discontented multitude was silenced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here,\" said he, striking his hand upon the little boy\\'s shoulder,\\r\\n\"here\\'s the only one amongst you who has not uttered one word of reproach\\r\\nor complaint, and he has had but one bit of bread--a bit that I gave him\\r\\nmyself this day.  Here!\" said he, snatching the bun, which nobody had\\r\\ndared to touch, \"take it--it\\'s mine--I give it to you, though you are a\\r\\nGreybeard; you deserve it.  Eat it, and be an Archer.  You shall be my\\r\\ncaptain; will you?\" said he, lifting him up in his arm above the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I like you now,\" said the little boy, courageously; \"but I love De Grey\\r\\nbetter; he has always been my friend, and he advised me never to call\\r\\nmyself any of those names, Archer or Greybeard; so I won\\'t.  Though I am\\r\\nshut in here, I have nothing to do with it.  I love Dr.  Middleton; he\\r\\nwas never unjust to ME, and I daresay that he has very good reasons, as\\r\\nDe Grey said, for forbidding us to go into that house.  Besides, it\\'s his\\r\\nown.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of admiring the good sense and steadiness of this little lad,\\r\\nArcher suffered Townsend to snatch the untasted bun out of his hands.  He\\r\\nflung it at a hole in the window, but it fell back.  The Archers\\r\\nscrambled for it, and Fisher ate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher saw this, and was sensible that he had not done handsomely in\\r\\nsuffering it.  A few moments ago he had admired his own generosity, and\\r\\nthough he had felt the injustice of others, he had not accused himself of\\r\\nany.  He turned away from the little boy, and sitting down at one end of\\r\\nthe table, hid his face in his hands.  He continued immovable in this\\r\\nposture for some time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord!\" said Townsend; \"it was an excellent joke!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pooh!\" said Fisher; \"what a fool, to think so much about a bun!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind, Mr. Archer, if you are thinking about me,\" said the little\\r\\nboy, trying gently to pull his hands from his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher stooped down, and lifted him up upon the table, at which sight the\\r\\npartisans set up a general hiss.  \"He has forsaken us!  He deserts his\\r\\nparty!  He wants to be a Greybeard!  After he has got us all into this\\r\\nscrape, he will leave us!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not going to leave you,\" cried Archer.  \"No one shall ever accuse\\r\\nme of deserting my party.  I\\'ll stick by the Archers, right or wrong, I\\r\\ntell you, to the last moment.  But this little fellow--take it as you\\r\\nplease, mutiny if you will, and throw me out of the window.  Call me\\r\\ntraitor! coward! Greybeard!--this little fellow is worth you all put\\r\\ntogether, and I\\'ll stand by him against anyone who dares to lay a finger\\r\\nupon him; and the next morsel of food that I see shall be his.  Touch him\\r\\nwho dares!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commanding air with which Archer spoke and looked, and the belief\\r\\nthat the little boy deserved his protection, silenced the crowd.  But the\\r\\nstorm was only hushed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sound of merriment was now to be heard--no battledore and shuttlecock-\\r\\n-no ball, no marbles.  Some sat in a corner, whispering their wishes that\\r\\nArcher would unbar the doors, and give up.  Others, stretching their\\r\\narms, and gaping as they sauntered up and down the room, wished for air,\\r\\nor food, or water.  Fisher and his nine, who had such firm dependence\\r\\nupon the gipsy, now gave themselves up to utter despair.  It was eight\\r\\no\\'clock, growing darker and darker every minute, and no candles, no light\\r\\ncould they have.  The prospect of another long dark night made them still\\r\\nmore discontented.\\r\\n\\r\\nTownsend, at the head of the yawners, and Fisher, at the head of the\\r\\nhungry malcontents, gathered round Archer and the few yet unconquered\\r\\nspirits, demanding \"How long he meant to keep them in this dark dungeon?\\r\\nand whether he expected that they should starve themselves for his sake?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of GIVING UP was more intolerable to Archer than all the rest.\\r\\nHe saw that the majority, his own convincing argument, was against him.\\r\\nHe was therefore obliged to condescend to the arts of persuasion.  He\\r\\nflattered some with hopes of food from the town boys.  Some he reminded\\r\\nof their promises; others he praised for former prowess; and others he\\r\\nshamed by the repetition of their high vaunts in the beginning of the\\r\\nbusiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at length resolved that at all events they WOULD HOLD OUT.  With\\r\\nthis determination they stretched themselves again to sleep, for the\\r\\nsecond night, in weak and weary obstinacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher slept longer and more soundly than usual the next morning, and\\r\\nwhen he awoke, he found his hands tied behind him!  Three or four boys\\r\\nhad just got hold of his feet, which they pressed down, whilst the\\r\\ntrembling hands of Fisher were fastening the cord round them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith all the force which rage could inspire, Archer struggled and roared\\r\\nto \"HIS ARCHERS!\"--his friends, his party--for help against the traitors.\\r\\nBut all kept aloof.  Townsend, in particular, stood laughing and looking\\r\\non.  \"I beg your pardon, Archer, but really you look so droll.  All alive\\r\\nand kicking!  Don\\'t be angry.  I\\'m so weak, I cannot help laughing\\r\\ntoday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe packthread cracked.  \"His hands are free!  He\\'s loose!\" cried the\\r\\nleast of the boys, and ran away, whilst Archer leaped up, and seizing\\r\\nhold of Fisher with a powerful grasp, sternly demanded \"What he meant by\\r\\nthis?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ask my party,\" said Fisher, terrified; \"they set me on; ask my party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your party!\" cried Archer, with a look of ineffable contempt; \"you\\r\\nreptile!--YOUR party?  Can such a thing as YOU have a party?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure!\" said Fisher, settling his collar, which Archer in his\\r\\nsurprise had let go; \"to be sure!  Why not?  Any man who chooses it may\\r\\nhave a party as well as yourself, I suppose.  I have nine Fishermen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt these words, spoken with much sullen importance, Archer, in spite of\\r\\nhis vexation, could not help laughing.  \"Fishermen!\" cried he,\\r\\n\"FISHERMEN!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why not Fishermen as well as Archers?\" cried they.  \"One party is\\r\\njust as good as another; it is only a question which can get the upper\\r\\nhand; and we had your hands tied just now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s right, Townsend,\" said Archer, \"laugh on, my boy!  Friend or foe,\\r\\nit\\'s all the same to you.  I know how to value your friendship now.  You\\r\\nare a mighty good fellow when the sun shines; but let a storm come, and\\r\\nhow you slink away!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant, Archer felt the difference between A GOOD COMPANION and\\r\\na good friend, a difference which some people do not discover till late\\r\\nin life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have I no friend?--no real friend amongst you all?  And could ye stand\\r\\nby, and see my hands tied behind me like a thief\\'s?  What signifies such\\r\\na party--all mute?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We want something to eat,\" answered the Fishermen.  \"What signifies SUCH\\r\\na party, indeed? and SUCH a manager, who can do nothing for one?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have _I_ done nothing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t let\\'s hear any more prosing,\" said Fisher; \"we are too many for\\r\\nyou.  I\\'ve advised my party, if they\\'ve a mind not to be starved, to give\\r\\nyou up for the ringleader, as you were; and Dr. Middleton will not let us\\r\\nall off, I daresay.\"  So, depending upon the sullen silence of the\\r\\nassembly, he again approached Archer with a cord.  A cry of \"No, no, no!\\r\\nDon\\'t tie him,\" was feebly raised.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher stood still, but the moment Fisher touched him he knocked him down\\r\\nto the ground, and turning to the rest, with eyes sparkling with\\r\\nindignation, \"Archers!\" cried he.  A voice at this instant was heard at\\r\\nthe door.  It was De Grey\\'s voice.  \"I have got a large basket of\\r\\nprovisions for your breakfast.\"  A general shout of joy was sent forth by\\r\\nthe voracious public.  \"Breakfast!  Provisions!  A large basket!  De Grey\\r\\nfor ever!  Huzza!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDe Grey promised, upon his honour, that if he would unbar the door nobody\\r\\nshould come in with him, and no advantage should be taken of them.  This\\r\\npromise was enough even for Archer.  \"I will let him in,\" said he,\\r\\n\"myself; for I\\'m sure he\\'ll never break his word.\"  He pulled away the\\r\\nbar; the door opened, and having bargained for the liberty of Melson, the\\r\\nlittle boy, who had been shut in by mistake, De Grey entered with his\\r\\nbasket of provisions, when he locked and barred the door instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoy and gratitude sparkled in every face when he unpacked his basket, and\\r\\nspread the table with a plentiful breakfast.  A hundred questions were\\r\\nasked him at once.  \"Eat first,\" said he, \"and we will talk afterwards.\"\\r\\nThis business was quickly despatched by those who had not tasted food for\\r\\na long while.  Their curiosity increased as their hunger diminished.\\r\\n\"Who sent us breakfast?  Does Dr. Middleton know?\" were questions\\r\\nreiterated from every mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He does know,\" answered De Grey; \"and the first thing I have to tell you\\r\\nis, that I am your fellow-prisoner.  I am to stay here till you give up.\\r\\nThis was the only condition on which Dr. Middleton would allow me to\\r\\nbring you food, and he will allow no more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone looked at the empty basket.  But Archer, in whom half vanquished\\r\\nparty spirit revived with the strength he had got from his breakfast,\\r\\nbroke into exclamations in praise of De Grey\\'s magnanimity, as he now\\r\\nimagined that De Grey had become one of themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you will join us, will you?  That\\'s a noble fellow!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" answered De Grey, calmly; \"but I hope to persuade, or rather to\\r\\nconvince you, that you ought to join me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You would have found it no hard task to have persuaded or convinced us,\\r\\nwhichever you pleased,\" said Townsend, \"if you had appealed to Archers\\r\\nfasting; but Archers feasting are quite other animals.  Even Caesar\\r\\nhimself, after breakfast, is quite another thing!\" added he, pointing to\\r\\nArcher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may speak for yourself, Mr. Townsend,\" replied the insulted hero,\\r\\n\"but not for me, or for Archers in general, if you please.  We unbarred\\r\\nthe door upon the faith of De Grey\\'s promise--THAT was not giving up.\\r\\nAnd it would have been just as difficult, I promise you, to persuade or\\r\\nconvince me either that I should give up against my honour before\\r\\nbreakfast as after.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis spirited speech was applauded by many, who had now forgotten the\\r\\nfeelings of famine.  Not so Fisher, whose memory was upon this occasion\\r\\nvery distinct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What nonsense,\" and the orator paused for a synonymous expression, but\\r\\nnone was at hand.  \"What nonsense and--nonsense is here!  Why, don\\'t you\\r\\nremember that dinner-time, and supper-time and breakfast-time will come\\r\\nagain?  So what signifies mouthing about persuading and convincing?  We\\r\\nwill not go through again what we did yesterday!  Honour me no honour.  I\\r\\ndon\\'t understand it.  I\\'d rather be flogged at once, as I have been\\r\\nmany\\'s the good time for a less thing.  I say, we\\'d better all be flogged\\r\\nat once, which must be the end of it sooner or later, than wait here to\\r\\nbe without dinner, breakfast, and supper, all only because Mr. Archer\\r\\nwon\\'t give up because of his honour and nonsense!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMany prudent faces amongst the Fishermen seemed to deliberate at the\\r\\nclose of this oration, in which the arguments were brought so \"home to\\r\\neach man\\'s business and bosom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" said De Grey, \"when we yield, I hope it will not be merely to get\\r\\nour dinner, gentlemen.  When we yield, Archer--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t address yourself to me,\" interrupted Archer, struggling with his\\r\\npride; \"you have no further occasion to try to win me.  I have no power,\\r\\nno party, you see!  And now I find that I have no friends, I don\\'t care\\r\\nwhat becomes of myself.  I suppose I\\'m to be given up as a ringleader.\\r\\nHere\\'s this Fisher, and a party of his Fishermen, were going to tie me\\r\\nhand and foot, if I had not knocked him down, just as you came to the\\r\\ndoor, De Grey; and now perhaps you will join Fisher\\'s party against me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDe Grey was going to assure him that he had no intention of joining any\\r\\nparty, when a sudden change appeared on Archer\\'s countenance.  \"Silence!\"\\r\\ncried Archer, in an imperious tone, and there was silence.  Someone was\\r\\nheard to whistle the beginning of a tune, that was perfectly new to\\r\\neverybody present, except to Archer, who immediately whistled the\\r\\nconclusion.  \"There!\" cried he, looking at De Grey, with triumph; \"that\\'s\\r\\na method of holding secret correspondence whilst a prisoner, which I\\r\\nlearned from \\'Richard Coeur de Lion.\\'  I know how to make use of\\r\\neverything.  Hallo! friend! are you there at last?\" cried he, going to\\r\\nthe ventilator.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but we are barred out here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Round to the window then, and fill our bag.  We\\'ll let it down, my lad,\\r\\nin a trice; bar me out who can!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher let down the bag with all the expedition of joy, and it was filled\\r\\nwith all the expedition of fear.  \"Pull away! make haste, for Heaven\\'s\\r\\nsake!\" said the voice from without; \"the gardener will come from dinner,\\r\\nelse, and we shall be caught.  He mounted guard all yesterday at the\\r\\nventilator; and though I watched and watched till it was darker than\\r\\npitch, I could not get near you.  I don\\'t know what has taken him out of\\r\\nthe way now.  Make haste, pull away!\"  The heavy bag was soon pulled up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any more?\" said Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, plenty.  Let down quick!  I\\'ve got the tailor\\'s bag full, which is\\r\\nthree times as large as yours, and I\\'ve changed clothes with the tailor\\'s\\r\\nboy; so nobody took notice of me as I came down the street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s my own cousin!\" exclaimed Archer, \"there\\'s a noble fellow!\\r\\nthere\\'s my own cousin, I acknowledge.  Fill the bag, then.\"  Several\\r\\ntimes the bag descended and ascended; and at every unlading of the crane,\\r\\nfresh acclamations were heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no more!\" at length the boy with the tailor\\'s bag cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Off with you, then; we\\'ve enough, and thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA delightful review was now made of their treasure.  Busy hands arranged\\r\\nand sorted the heterogeneous mass.  Archer, in the height of his glory,\\r\\nlooked on, the acknowledged master of the whole.  Townsend, who, in his\\r\\nprosperity as in adversity, saw and enjoyed the comic foibles of his\\r\\nfriends, pushed De Grey, who was looking on with a more good-natured and\\r\\nmore thoughtful air.  \"Friend,\" said he, \"you look like a great\\r\\nphilosopher, and Archer a great hero.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you, Townsend,\" said Archer, \"may look like a wit, if you will; but\\r\\nyou will never be a hero.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" replied Townsend; \"wits were never heroes, because they are\\r\\nwits.  You are out of your wits, and therefore may set up for a hero.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Laugh, and welcome.  I\\'m not a tyrant.  I don\\'t want to restrain\\r\\nanybody\\'s wit; but I cannot say I admire puns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor I, either,\" said the time serving Fisher, sidling up to the manager,\\r\\nand picking the ice off a piece of plum-cake, \"nor I either; I hate puns.\\r\\nI can never understand Townsend\\'s PUNS.  Besides, anybody can make puns;\\r\\nand one doesn\\'t want wit, either, at all times; for instance, when one is\\r\\ngoing to settle about dinner, or business of consequence.  Bless us all,\\r\\nArcher!\" continued he, with sudden familiarity; \"WHAT A SIGHT OF GOOD\\r\\nTHINGS ARE HERE!  I\\'m sure we are much obliged to you and your cousin.  I\\r\\nnever thought he\\'d have come.  Why, now we can hold out as long as you\\r\\nplease.  Let us see,\" said he, dividing the provisions upon the table;\\r\\n\"we can hold out to-day, and all to-morrow, and part of next day, maybe.\\r\\nWhy, now we may defy the doctor and the Greybeards.  The doctor will\\r\\nsurely give up to us; for, you see, he knows nothing of all this, and\\r\\nhe\\'ll think we are starving all this while; and he\\'d be afraid, you see,\\r\\nto let us starve quite, in reality, for three whole days, because of what\\r\\nwould be said in the town.  My Aunt Barbara, for one, would be AT HIM\\r\\nlong before that time was out; and besides, you know, in that case, he\\'d\\r\\nbe hanged for murder, which is quite another thing, in law, from a\\r\\nBARRING OUT, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher had not given to this harangue all the attention which it\\r\\ndeserved, for his eye was fixed upon De Grey.  \"What is De Grey thinking\\r\\nof?\" he asked, impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am thinking,\" said De Grey, \"that Dr. Middleton must believe that I\\r\\nhave betrayed his confidence in me.  The gardener was ordered away from\\r\\nhis watch-post for one half-hour when I was admitted.  This half-hour the\\r\\ngardener has made nearly a hour.  I never would have come near you if I\\r\\nhad foreseen all this.  Dr. Middleton trusted me, and now he will repent\\r\\nof his confidence in me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"De Grey!\" cried Archer, with energy, \"he shall not repent of his\\r\\nconfidence in you--nor shall you repent of coming amongst us. You shall\\r\\nfind that we have some honour as well as yourself, and I will take care\\r\\nof your honour as if it were my OWN!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hey-day!\" interrupted Townsend; \"are heroes allowed to change sides,\\r\\npray?  And does the chief of the Archers stand talking sentiment to the\\r\\nchief of the Greybeards?  In the middle of his own party too!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Party!\" repeated Archer, disdainfully; \"I have done with parties!  I see\\r\\nwhat parties are made of!  I have felt the want of a friend, and I am\\r\\ndetermined to make one if I can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That you may do,\" said De Grey, stretching out his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unbar the doors! unbar the windows!\" exclaimed Archer.  \"Away with all\\r\\nthese things!  I give up for De Grey\\'s sake.  He shall not lose his\\r\\ncredit on my account.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said De Grey, \"you shall not give up for my sake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, I\\'ll give up to do what is HONOURABLE,\" said Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not to do what is REASONABLE?\" said De Grey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"REASONABLE!  Oh, the first thing that a man of spirit should think of\\r\\nis, what is HONOURABLE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how will he find out WHAT IS honourable, unless he can reason?\"\\r\\nreplied De Grey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh,\" said Archer, \"his own feelings always tell him what is honourable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have not YOUR FEELINGS,\" asked De Grey, \"changed within these few\\r\\nhours?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, with circumstances,\" replied Archer; \"but right or wrong, as long\\r\\nas I think it honourable to do so and so, I\\'m satisfied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you cannot think anything honourable, or the contrary,\" observed De\\r\\nGrey, \"without reasoning; and as to what you call feeling, it\\'s only a\\r\\nquick sort of reasoning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The quicker, the better,\" said Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps not,\" said De Grey.  \"We are apt to reason best when we are not\\r\\nin quite so great a hurry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" said Archer, \"we have not always time enough to reason AT FIRST.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must, however, acknowledge,\" replied De Grey, smiling, \"that no man\\r\\nbut a fool thinks it honourable to be in the wrong AT LAST.  Is it not,\\r\\ntherefore, best to begin by reasoning to find out the right AT FIRST?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure,\" said Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And did you reason with yourself at first?  And did you find out that it\\r\\nwas right to bar Dr. Middleton out of his own schoolroom, because he\\r\\ndesired you not to go into one of his own houses?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Archer; \"but I should never have thought of heading a\\r\\nBarring Out, if he had not shown partiality; and if you had flown into a\\r\\npassion with me openly at once for pulling down your scenery, which would\\r\\nhave been quite natural, and not have gone slily and forbid us the house\\r\\nout of revenge, there would have been none of this work.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" said De Grey, \"should you suspect me of such a mean action, when\\r\\nyou have never seen or known me do anything mean, and when in this\\r\\ninstance you have no proofs?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you give me your word and honour now, De Grey, before everybody\\r\\nhere, that you did not do what I suspected?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do assure you, upon my honour, I never, indirectly, spoke to Dr.\\r\\nMiddleton about the playhouse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" said Archer, \"I\\'m as glad as if I had found a thousand pounds!\\r\\nNow you are my friend indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Dr. Middleton--why should you suspect him without reason any more\\r\\nthan me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As to that,\" said Archer, \"he is your friend, and you are right to\\r\\ndefend him; and I won\\'t say another word against him.  Will that satisfy\\r\\nyou?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not quite.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not quite!  Then, indeed you are unreasonable!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied De Grey; \"for I don\\'t wish you to yield out of friendship\\r\\nto me, any more than to honour.  If you yield to reason, you will be\\r\\ngoverned by reason another time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well; but then don\\'t triumph over me, because you have the best side of\\r\\nthe argument.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I!  How can I?\" said De Grey; \"for now you are on THE BEST SIDE as\\r\\nwell as myself, are not you?  So we may triumph together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a good friend!\" said Archer; and with great eagerness he pulled\\r\\ndown the fortifications, whilst every hand assisted.  The room was\\r\\nrestored to order in a few minutes--the shutters were thrown open, the\\r\\ncheerful light let in.  The windows were thrown up, and the first feeling\\r\\nof the fresh air was delightful.  The green playgound opened before them,\\r\\nand the hopes of exercise and liberty brightened the countenances of\\r\\nthese voluntary prisoners.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, alas! they were not yet at liberty.  The idea of Dr. Middleton, and\\r\\nthe dread of his vengeance, smote their hearts.  When the rebels had sent\\r\\nan ambassador with their surrender, they stood in pale and silent\\r\\nsuspense, waiting for their doom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said Fisher, looking up at the broken panes in the windows, \"the\\r\\ndoctor will think the most of THAT--he\\'ll never forgive us for that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hush! here he comes!\"  His steady step was heard approaching nearer and\\r\\nnearer.  Archer threw open the door, and Dr. Middleton entered.  Fisher\\r\\ninstantly fell on his knees.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is no delight to me to see people on their knees.  Stand up, Mr.\\r\\nFisher.  I hope you are all conscious that you have done wrong?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir,\" said Archer, \"they are conscious that they have done wrong, and so\\r\\nam I.  I am the ringleader.  Punish me as you think proper.  I submit.\\r\\nYour punishments--your vengeance ought to fall on me alone!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir,\" said Dr. Middleton, calmly, \"I perceive that whatever else you may\\r\\nhave learned in the course of your education, you have not been taught\\r\\nthe meaning of the word punishment.  Punishment and vengeance do not with\\r\\nus mean the same thing.  PUNISHMENT is pain given, with the reasonable\\r\\nhope of preventing those on whom it is inflicted from doing, IN FUTURE,\\r\\nwhat will hurt themselves or others.  VENGEANCE never looks to the\\r\\nFUTURE, but is the expression of anger for an injury that is past.  I\\r\\nfeel no anger; you have done me no injury.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere many of the little boys looked timidly up to the windows.  \"Yes, I\\r\\nsee that you have broken my windows; that is a small evil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, sir!  How good!  How merciful!\" exclaimed those who had been most\\r\\npanic-struck.  \"He forgives us!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stay,\" resumed Dr. Middleton; \"I cannot forgive you.  I shall never\\r\\nrevenge, but it is my duty to punish.  You have rebelled against the just\\r\\nauthority which is necessary to conduct and govern you whilst you have\\r\\nnot sufficient reason to govern and conduct yourselves.  Without\\r\\nobedience to the laws,\" added he, turning to Archer, \"as men, you cannot\\r\\nbe suffered in society.  You, sir, think yourself a man, I observe; and\\r\\nyou think it the part of a man not to submit to the will of another.  I\\r\\nhave no pleasure in making others, whether men or children, submit to my\\r\\nWILL; but my reason and experience are superior to yours.  Your parents\\r\\nat least think so, or they would not have intrusted me with the care of\\r\\nyour education.  As long as they do intrust you to my care, and as long\\r\\nas I have any hopes of making you wiser and better by punishment, I shall\\r\\nsteadily inflict it, whenever I judge it to be necessary, and I judge it\\r\\nto be necessary NOW.  This is a long sermon, Mr. Archer, not preached to\\r\\nshow my own eloquence, but to convince your understanding.  Now, as to\\r\\nyour punishment!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Name it, sir,\" said Archer;  \"whatever it is, I will cheerfully submit\\r\\nto it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Name it yourself,\" said Dr. Middleton, \"and show me that you now\\r\\nunderstand the nature of punishment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArcher, proud to be treated like a reasonable creature, and sorry that he\\r\\nhad behaved like a foolish schoolboy, was silent for some time, but at\\r\\nlength replied, \"That he would rather not name his own punishment.\"  He\\r\\nrepeated, however, that he trusted he should bear it well, whatever it\\r\\nmight be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall, then,\" said Dr. Middleton, \"deprive you, for two months, of\\r\\npocket-money, as you have had too much, and have made a bad use of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir,\" said Archer, \"I brought five guineas with me to school.  This\\r\\nguinea is all that I have left.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Middleton received the guinea which Archer offered him with a look of\\r\\napprobation, and told him that it should be applied to the repairs of the\\r\\nschoolroom.  The rest of the boys waited in silence for the doctor\\'s\\r\\nsentence against them, but not with those looks of abject fear with which\\r\\nboys usually expect the sentence of a schoolmaster.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall return from the playground, all of you,\" said Dr. Middleton,\\r\\n\"one quarter of an hour sooner, for two months to come, than the rest of\\r\\nyour companions.  A bell shall ring at the appointed time.  I give you an\\r\\nopportunity of recovering my confidence by your punctuality.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, sir! we will come the instant, the very instant the bell rings; you\\r\\nshall have confidence in us,\" cried they, eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I deserve your confidence, I hope,\" said Dr. Middleton; \"for it is my\\r\\nfirst wish to make you all happy.  You do not know the pain that it has\\r\\ncost me to deprive you of food for so many hours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the boys, with one accord, ran to the place where they had deposited\\r\\ntheir last supplies.  Archer delivered them up to the doctor, proud to\\r\\nshow that they were not reduced to obedience merely by necessity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The reason,\" resumed Dr. Middleton, having now returned to the usual\\r\\nbenignity of his manner--\"the reason why I desired that none of you\\r\\nshould go to that building,\" pointing out of the window, \"was this:--I\\r\\nhad been informed that a gang of gipsies had slept there the night before\\r\\nI spoke to you, one of whom was dangerously ill of a putrid fever.  I did\\r\\nnot choose to mention my reason to you or your friends.  I have had the\\r\\nplace cleaned, and you may return to it when you please.  The gipsies\\r\\nwere yesterday removed from the town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"De Grey, you were in the right,\" whispered Archer, \"and it was I that\\r\\nwas UNJUST.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The old woman,\" continued the doctor, \"whom you employed to buy food,\\r\\nhas escaped the fever, but she has not escaped a gaol, whither she was\\r\\nsent yesterday, for having defrauded you of your money.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Fisher,\" said Dr. Middleton, \"as to you, I shall not punish you; I\\r\\nhave no hope of making you either wiser or better.  Do you know this\\r\\npaper?\"--the paper appeared to be a bill for candles and a tinder-box.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I desired him to buy those things, sir,\" said Archer, colouring.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And did you desire him not to pay for them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Archer, \"he had half a crown on purpose to pay for them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know he had, but he chose to apply it to his private use, and gave it\\r\\nto the gipsy to buy twelve buns for his own eating.  To obtain credit for\\r\\nthe tinder-box and candles, he made use of THIS name,\" said he, turning\\r\\nto the other side of the bill, and pointing to De Grey\\'s name, which was\\r\\nwritten at the end of a copy of one of De Grey\\'s exercises.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I assure you, sir--\" cried Archer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You need not assure me, sir,\" said Dr. Middleton; \"I cannot suspect a\\r\\nboy of your temper of having any part in so base an action.  When the\\r\\npeople in the shop refused to let Mr. Fisher have the things without\\r\\npaying for them, he made use of De Grey\\'s name, who was known there.\\r\\nSuspecting some mischief, however, from the purchase of the tinder-box,\\r\\nthe shopkeeper informed me of the circumstance.  Nothing in this whole\\r\\nbusiness gave me half so much pain as I felt, for a moment, when I\\r\\nsuspected that De Grey was concerned in it.\"  A loud cry, in which\\r\\nArcher\\'s voice was heard most distinctly, declared De Grey\\'s innocence.\\r\\nDr. Middleton looked round at their eager, honest faces, with benevolent\\r\\napprobation.  \"Archer,\" said he, taking him by the hand, \"I am heartily\\r\\nglad to see that you have got the better of your party spirit.  I wish\\r\\nyou may keep such a friend as you have now beside you; one such friend is\\r\\nworth two such parties.  As for you, Mr. Fisher, depart; you must never\\r\\nreturn hither again.\"  In vain he solicited Archer and De Grey to\\r\\nintercede for him.  Everybody turned away with contempt; and he sneaked\\r\\nout, whimpering in a doleful voice, \"What shall I say to my Aunt\\r\\nBarbara?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BRACELETS.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a beautiful and retired part of England lived Mrs. Villars, a lady\\r\\nwhose accurate understanding, benevolent heart, and steady temper\\r\\npeculiarly fitted her for the most difficult, as well as most important,\\r\\nof all occupations--the education of youth.  This task she had\\r\\nundertaken; and twenty young persons were put under her care, with the\\r\\nperfect confidence of their parents.  No young people could be happier;\\r\\nthey were good and gay, emulous, but not envious of each other; for Mrs.\\r\\nVillars was impartially just; her praise they felt to be the reward of\\r\\nmerit, and her blame they knew to be the necessary consequence of ill-\\r\\nconduct.  To the one, therefore, they patiently submitted, and in the\\r\\nother consciously rejoiced.  They rose with fresh cheerfulness in the\\r\\nmorning, eager to pursue their various occupations.  They returned in the\\r\\nevening with renewed ardour to their amusements, and retired to rest\\r\\nsatisfied with themselves and pleased with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing so much contributed to preserve a spirit of emulation in this\\r\\nlittle society as a small honorary distinction, given annually, as a\\r\\nprize of successful application.  The prize this year was peculiarly dear\\r\\nto each individual, as it was the picture of a friend whom they dearly\\r\\nloved.  It was the picture of Mrs. Villars in a small bracelet.  It\\r\\nwanted neither gold, pearls nor precious stones to give it value.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two foremost candidates for this prize were Cecilia and Leonora.\\r\\nCecilia was the most intimate friend of Leonora; but Leonora was only the\\r\\nfavourite companion of Cecilia.\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia was of an active, ambitious, enterprising disposition, more eager\\r\\nin the pursuit than happy in the enjoyment of her wishes.  Leonora was of\\r\\na contented, unaspiring temperate character; not easily roused to action,\\r\\nbut indefatigable when once excited.  Leonora was proud; Cecilia was\\r\\nvain.  Her vanity made her more dependent upon the approbation of others,\\r\\nand therefore more anxious to please than Leonora; but that very vanity\\r\\nmade her, at the same time, more apt to offend.  In short, Leonora was\\r\\nthe most anxious to avoid what was wrong;  Cecilia, the most ambitious to\\r\\ndo what was right.  Few of her companions loved, but many were led by\\r\\nCecilia, for she was often successful.  Many loved Leonora, but none were\\r\\never governed by her, for she was too indolent to govern.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the first day of May, about six o\\'clock in the evening, a great bell\\r\\nrang, to summon this little society into a hall, where the prize was to\\r\\nbe decided.  A number of small tables were placed in a circle in the\\r\\nmiddle of the hall.  Seats for the young competitors were raised one\\r\\nabove another, in a semicircle, some yards distant from the table, and\\r\\nthe judges\\' chairs, under canopies of lilacs and laburnums, forming\\r\\nanother semicircle, closed the amphitheatre.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone put their writings, their drawings, their works of various kinds\\r\\nupon the tables appropriated for each.  How unsteady were the last steps\\r\\nto these tables!  How each little hand trembled as it laid down its\\r\\nclaims!  Till this moment everyone thought herself secure of success; and\\r\\nthe heart, which exulted with hope, now palpitated with fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe works were examined, the preference adjudged, and the prize was\\r\\ndeclared to be the happy Cecilia\\'s.  Mrs. Villars came forward, smiling,\\r\\nwith the bracelet in her hand.  Cecilia was behind her companions, on the\\r\\nhighest row.  All the others gave way, and she was on the floor in an\\r\\ninstant.  Mrs. Villars clasped the bracelet on her arm; the clasp was\\r\\nheard through the whole hall, and a universal smile of congratulation\\r\\nfollowed.  Mrs. Villars kissed Cecilia\\'s little hand.  \"And now,\" said\\r\\nshe, \"go and rejoice with your companions; the remainder of the day is\\r\\nyours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! you whose hearts are elated with success, whose bosoms beat high with\\r\\njoy in the moment of triumph, command yourselves.  Let that triumph be\\r\\nmoderate, that it may be lasting.  Consider, that though you are good,\\r\\nyou may be better; and, though wise, you may be weak.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Mrs. Villars had given her the bracelet, all Cecilia\\'s little\\r\\ncompanions crowded round her, and they all left the hall in an instant.\\r\\nShe was full of spirits and vanity.  She ran on.  Running down the flight\\r\\nof steps which led to the garden, in her violent haste, Cecilia threw\\r\\ndown the little Louisa, who had a china mandarin in her hand, which her\\r\\nmother had sent her that very morning, and which was all broken to pieces\\r\\nby her fall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my mandarin!\" cried Louisa, bursting into tears.  The crowd behind\\r\\nCecilia suddenly stopped.  Louisa sat on the lowest step, fixing her eyes\\r\\nupon the broken pieces.  Then, turning round, she hid her face in her\\r\\nhands upon the step above her.  In turning, Louisa threw down the remains\\r\\nof the mandarin.  The head, which she placed in the socket, fell from the\\r\\nshoulders, and rolled, bounding along the gravel walk.  Cecilia pointed\\r\\nto the head and to the socket, and burst into laughter.  The crowd behind\\r\\nlaughed, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt any other time they would have been more inclined to cry with Louisa;\\r\\nbut Cecilia had just been successful, and sympathy with the victorious\\r\\noften makes us forget justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonora, however, preserved her usual consistency.  \"Poor Louisa!\" said\\r\\nshe, looking first at her, and then reproachfully at Cecilia.  Cecilia\\r\\nturned sharply round, colouring, half with shame and half with vexation.\\r\\n\"I could not help it, Leonora,\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you could have helped laughing, Cecilia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I didn\\'t laugh at Louisa; and I surely may laugh, for it does nobody any\\r\\nharm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure, however,\" replied Leonora, \"I should not have laughed if I\\r\\nhad--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, to be sure, you wouldn\\'t, because Louisa is your favourite.  I can\\r\\nbuy her another mandarin when the old peddler comes to the door, if\\r\\nthat\\'s all.  I CAN do no more, CAN I?\" said she, again turning round to\\r\\nher companions.  \"No, to be sure,\" said they; \"that\\'s all fair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia looked triumphantly at Leonora.  Leonora let go her hand; she ran\\r\\non, and the crowd followed.  When she got to the end of the garden, she\\r\\nturned round to see if Leonora had followed her, too; but was vexed to\\r\\nsee her still sitting on the steps with Louisa.  \"I\\'m sure I can do no\\r\\nmore than buy her another, CAN I!\" said she, again appealing to her\\r\\ncompanions.  \"No, to be sure,\" said they, eager to begin their play.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow many games did these juvenile playmates begin and leave off, before\\r\\nCecilia could be satisfied with any!  Her thoughts were discomposed, and\\r\\nher mind was running upon something else.  No wonder, then, that she did\\r\\nnot play with her usual address.  She grew still more impatient.  She\\r\\nthrew down the ninepins.  \"Come, let us play at something else--at\\r\\nthreading the needle,\" said she, holding out her hand.  They all yielded\\r\\nto the hand which wore the bracelet.  But Cecilia, dissatisfied with\\r\\nherself, was discontented with everybody else.  Her tone grew more and\\r\\nmore peremptory.  One was too rude, another too stiff; one too slow,\\r\\nanother too quick; in short everything went wrong, and everybody was\\r\\ntired of her humours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe triumph of SUCCESS is absolute, but short.  Cecilia\\'s companions at\\r\\nlength recollected that though she had embroidered a tulip, and painted a\\r\\npeach, better than they, yet that they could play as well, and keep their\\r\\ntempers better; for she was discomposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalking towards the house in a peevish mood, Cecilia met Leonora, but\\r\\npassed on.  \"Cecilia!\" cried Leonora.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what do you want with me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are we friends?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know best,\" said Cecilia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are, if you will let me tell Louisa that you are sorry--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia, interrupting her, \"Oh, pray let me hear no more about Louisa!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! not confess that you were in the wrong?  Oh, Cecilia! I had a\\r\\nbetter opinion of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your opinion is of no consequence to me now, for you don\\'t love me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; not when you are unjust, Cecilia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unjust! I am not unjust; and if I were, you are not my governess.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, but am not I your friend?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t desire to have such a friend, who would quarrel with me for\\r\\nhappening to throw down little Louisa.  How could I tell that she had a\\r\\nmandarin in her hand? and when it was broken, could I do more than\\r\\npromise her another; was that unjust?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you know, Cecilia--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I KNOW,\" ironically.  \"I know, Leonora, that you love Louisa better than\\r\\nyou love me; that\\'s the injustice!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I did,\" replied Leonora, gravely, \"it would be no injustice, if she\\r\\ndeserved it better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you compare Louisa to me!\" exclaimed Cecilia, indignantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonora made no answer; for she was really hurt at her friend\\'s conduct.\\r\\nShe walked on to join the rest of her companions.  They were dancing in a\\r\\nround upon the grass.  Leonora declined dancing; but they prevailed upon\\r\\nher to sing for them.  Her voice was not so sprightly, but it was sweeter\\r\\nthan usual.  Who sang so sweetly as Leonora? or who danced so nimbly as\\r\\nLouisa?  Away she was flying, all spirits and gaiety, when Leonora\\'s eyes\\r\\nfull of tears, caught hers.  Louisa silently let go her companion\\'s hand,\\r\\nand, quitting the dance, ran up to Leonora to inquire what was the matter\\r\\nwith her.  \"Nothing,\" replied she, \"that need interrupt you.  Go, my\\r\\ndear; go and dance again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa immediately ran away to her garden, and pulling off her little\\r\\nstraw hat, she lined it with the freshest strawberry-leaves, and was upon\\r\\nher knees before the strawberry-bed when Cecilia came by.  Cecilia was\\r\\nnot disposed to be pleased with Louisa at that instant, for two reasons;\\r\\nbecause she was jealous of her, and because she had injured her.  The\\r\\ninjury, however, Louisa had already forgotten.  Perhaps to tell things\\r\\njust as they were, she was not quite so much inclined to kiss Cecilia as\\r\\nshe would have been before the fall of her mandarin; but this was the\\r\\nutmost extent of her malice, if it can be called malice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you doing there, little one?\" said Cecilia, in a sharp tone.\\r\\n\"Are you eating your early strawberries here all alone?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Louisa, mysteriously, \"I am not eating them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you doing with them? can\\'t you answer, then?  I\\'m not playing\\r\\nwith you, child!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, as to that, Cecilia, you know I need not answer you unless I choose\\r\\nit; not but what I would if you would only ask me civilly, and if you\\r\\nwould not call me CHILD.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should not I call you child?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because--because--I don\\'t know; but I wish you would stand out of my\\r\\nlight, Cecilia, for you are trampling upon all my strawberries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not touched one, you covetous little creature!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed--indeed, Cecilia, I am not covetous.  I have not eaten one of\\r\\nthem; they are all for your friend Leonora.  See how unjust you are!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unjust! that\\'s a cant word which you learnt of my friend Leonora, as you\\r\\ncall her; but she is not my friend now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not your friend now!\" exclaimed Louisa; \"then I am sure you must have\\r\\ndone something VERY naughty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How?\" cried Cecilia, catching hold of her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me go, let me go!\" cried Louisa, struggling.  \"I won\\'t give you one\\r\\nof my strawberries, for I don\\'t like you at all!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t, don\\'t you?\" cried Cecilia, provoked, and, catching the hat\\r\\nfrom Louisa, she flung the strawberries over the hedge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will nobody help me?\" exclaimed Louisa, snatching her hat again, and\\r\\nrunning away with all her force.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What have I done?\" said Cecilia, recollecting herself; \"Louisa! Louisa!\"\\r\\nshe called very loud, but Louisa would not turn back; she was running to\\r\\nher companions, who were still dancing, hand in hand, upon the grass,\\r\\nwhilst Leonora, sitting in the middle, was singing to them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop! stop! and hear me!\" cried Louisa, breaking through them; and,\\r\\nrushing up to Leonora, she threw her hat at her feet, and panting for\\r\\nbreath--\"It was full--almost full of my own strawberries,\" said she, \"the\\r\\nfirst I ever got out of my garden.  They should all have been for you,\\r\\nLeonora; but now I have not one left.  They are all gone!\" said she; and\\r\\nshe hid her face in Leonora\\'s lap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gone! gone where?\" said everyone, at once running up to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cecilia! Cecilia!\" said she, sobbing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cecilia,\" repeated Leonora, \"what of Cecilia?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it was--it was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come with me,\" said Leonora, unwilling to have her friend exposed.\\r\\n\"Come, and I will get you some more strawberries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t mind the strawberries, indeed; but I wanted to have had the\\r\\npleasure of giving them to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonora took her up in her arms to carry her away, but it was too late.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, Cecilia! Cecilia, who won the prize!  It could not surely be\\r\\nCecilia,\" whispered every busy tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant the bell summoned them in.  \"There she is!  There she\\r\\nis!\" cried they, pointing to an arbour, where Cecilia was standing\\r\\nashamed and alone; and, as they passed her, some lifted up their hands\\r\\nand eyes with astonishment, others whispered and huddled mysteriously\\r\\ntogether, as if to avoid her.  Leonora walked on, her head a little\\r\\nhigher than usual.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leonora!\" said Cecilia, timorously, as she passed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Cecilia! who would have thought that you had a bad heart?\"  Cecilia\\r\\nturned her head aside and burst into tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, indeed, she has not a bad heart!\" cried Louisa, running up to\\r\\nher and throwing her arms around her neck.  \"She\\'s very sorry; are not\\r\\nyou, Cecilia?  But don\\'t cry any more, for I forgive you, with all my\\r\\nheart--and I love you now, though I said I did not when I was in a\\r\\npassion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you sweet-tempered girl! how I love you!\" said Cecilia, kissing her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, if you do, come along with me, and dry your eyes, for they\\r\\nare so red!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go, my dear, and I\\'ll come presently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I will keep a place for you, next to me; but you must make haste,\\r\\nor you will have to come in when we have all sat down to supper, and then\\r\\nyou will be so stared at!  So don\\'t stay, now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia followed Louisa with her eyes till she was out of sight.  \"And is\\r\\nLouisa,\" said she, to herself, \"the only one who would stop to pity me?\\r\\nMrs. Villars told me that this day should be mine.  She little thought\\r\\nhow it would end!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSaying these words, Cecilia threw herself down upon the ground; her arm\\r\\nleaned upon a heap of turf which she had raised in the morning, and\\r\\nwhich, in the pride and gaiety of her heart, she had called her throne.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant, Mrs. Villars came out to enjoy the serenity of the\\r\\nevening, and, passing by the arbour where Cecilia lay, she started.\\r\\nCecilia rose hastily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is there?\" said Mrs. Villars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is I, madam.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And who is _I_?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cecilia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, what keeps you here, my dear?  Where are your companions?  This is,\\r\\nperhaps, one of the happiest days of your life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, madam,\" said Cecilia, hardly able to repress her tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, my dear, what is the matter?\"  Cecilia hesitated.  \"Speak, my dear.\\r\\nYou know that when I ask you to tell me anything as your friend, I never\\r\\npunish you as your governess; therefore you need not be afraid to tell me\\r\\nwhat is the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, madam, I am not afraid, but ashamed.  You asked me why I was not\\r\\nwith my companions.  Why, madam, because they have all left me, and--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what, my dear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I see that they all dislike me; and yet I don\\'t know why they\\r\\nshould, for I take as much pains to please as any of them.  All my\\r\\nmasters seem satisfied with me; and you yourself, madam, were pleased\\r\\nthis very morning to give me this bracelet; and I am sure you would not\\r\\nhave given it to anyone who did not deserve it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not,\" said Mrs. Villars.  \"You well deserve it for your\\r\\napplication--for your successful application.  The prize was for the most\\r\\nassiduous, not for the most amiable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, if it had been for the most amiable, it would not have been for\\r\\nme?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Villars, smiling,--\"Why, what do you think yourself, Cecilia?  You\\r\\nare better able to judge than I am.  I can determine whether or no you\\r\\napply to what I give you to learn; whether you attend to what I desire\\r\\nyou to do, and avoid what I desire you not to do.  I know that I like you\\r\\nas a pupil, but I cannot know that I should like you as a companion,\\r\\nunless I were your companion.  Therefore I must judge of what I should\\r\\ndo, by seeing what others do in the same circumstances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, pray don\\'t, madam! for then you would not love me either.  And yet I\\r\\nthink you would love me; for I hope that I am as ready to oblige, and as\\r\\ngood-natured as--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Cecilia, I don\\'t doubt but that you would be very good natured to\\r\\nme; but I\\'m afraid that I should not like you unless you were good-\\r\\ntempered, too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, madam, by good-natured I mean good-tempered--it\\'s all the same\\r\\nthing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, I understand by them two very different things.  You are\\r\\ngood-natured, Cecilia; for you are desirous to oblige and serve your\\r\\ncompanions--to gain them praise, and save them from blame--to give them\\r\\npleasure, and relieve them from pain; but Leonora is good-tempered, for\\r\\nshe can bear with their foibles, and acknowledge her own.  Without\\r\\ndisputing about the right, she sometimes yields to those who are in the\\r\\nwrong.  In short, her temper is perfectly good; for it can bear and\\r\\nforbear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish that mine could!\" said Cecilia, sighing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may,\" replied Mrs. Villars; \"but it is not wishes alone which can\\r\\nimprove us in anything.  Turn the same exertion and perseverance which\\r\\nhave won you the prize to-day to this object, and you will meet with the\\r\\nsame success; perhaps not on the first, the second, or the third attempt;\\r\\nbut depend upon it that you will at last.  Every new effort will weaken\\r\\nyour bad habits, and strengthen your good ones.  But you must not expect\\r\\nto succeed all at once.  I repeat it to you, for habit must be\\r\\ncounteracted by habit.  It would be as extravagant in us to expect that\\r\\nall our faults could be destroyed by one punishment, were it ever so\\r\\nsevere, as it was in the Roman emperor we were reading of a few days ago,\\r\\nto wish that all the heads of his enemies were upon one neck, that he\\r\\nmight cut them off at one blow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Mrs. Villars took Cecilia by the hand, and they began to walk home.\\r\\nSuch was the nature of Cecilia\\'s mind, that when any object was forcibly\\r\\nimpressed on her imagination, it caused a temporary suspension of her\\r\\nreasoning faculties.  Hope was too strong a stimulus for her spirits; and\\r\\nwhen fear did take possession of her mind, it was attended with total\\r\\ndebility.  Her vanity was now as much mortified as in the morning it had\\r\\nbeen elated.  She walked on with Mrs. Villars in silence, until they came\\r\\nunder the shade of the elm-tree walk, and there, fixing her eyes upon\\r\\nMrs. Villars, she stopped short.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think, madam,\" said she, with hesitation--\"do you think, madam,\\r\\nthat I have a bad heart?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A bad heart,--my dear! why, what put that into your head?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leonora said that I had, madam, and I felt ashamed when she said so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear, how can Leonora tell whether your heart be good or bad?\\r\\nHowever, in the first place, tell me what you mean by a bad heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I do not know what is meant by it, madam; but it is something\\r\\nwhich everybody hates.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why do they hate it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because they think that it will hurt them, ma\\'am, I believe:  and that\\r\\nthose who have bad hearts take delight in doing mischief; and that they\\r\\nnever do anybody any good but for their own ends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then the best definition,\" said Mrs. Villars, \"which you can give me of\\r\\na bad heart is, that it is some constant propensity to hurt others, and\\r\\nto do wrong for the sake of doing wrong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, madam; but that is not all either.  There is still something else\\r\\nmeant; something which I cannot express--which, indeed, I never\\r\\ndistinctly understood; but of which, therefore, I was the more afraid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, to begin with what you do understand, tell me, Cecilia, do\\r\\nyou really think it possible to be wicked merely for the love of\\r\\nwickedness?  No human being becomes wicked all at once.  A man begins by\\r\\ndoing wrong because it is, or because he thinks it, for his interest.  If\\r\\nhe continue to do so, he must conquer his sense of shame and lose his\\r\\nlove of virtue.  But how can you, Cecilia, who feel such a strong sense\\r\\nof shame, and such an eager desire to improve, imagine that you have a\\r\\nbad heart?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, madam, I never did, until everybody told me so, and then I began\\r\\nto be frightened about it.  This very evening, madam, when I was in a\\r\\npassion, I threw little Louisa\\'s strawberries away, which, I am sure, I\\r\\nwas very sorry for afterwards; and Leonora and everybody cried out that I\\r\\nhad a bad heart--but I am sure I was only in a passion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very likely.  And when you are in a passion, as you call it, Cecilia,\\r\\nyou see that you are tempted to do harm to others.  If they do not feel\\r\\nangry themselves, they do not sympathize with you.  They do not perceive\\r\\nthe motive which actuates you; and then they say that you have a bad\\r\\nheart.  I daresay, however, when your passion is over, and when you\\r\\nrecollect yourself, you are very sorry for what you have done and said;\\r\\nare not you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed, madam--very sorry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then make that sorry of use to you, Cecilia, and fix it steadily in your\\r\\nthoughts, as you hope to be good and happy, that if you suffer yourself\\r\\nto yield to your passion upon every occasion, anger and its consequences\\r\\nwill become familiar to your mind; and, in the same proportion, your\\r\\nsense of shame will be weakened, till what you began with doing from\\r\\nsudden impulse you will end with doing from habit and choice:  then you\\r\\nwould, indeed, according to our definition, have a bad heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, madam! I hope--I am sure I never shall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, Cecilia; I do, indeed, believe that you never will; on the\\r\\ncontrary, I think that you have a very good disposition, and what is of\\r\\ninfinitely more consequence to you, an active desire of improvement.\\r\\nShow me that you have as much perseverance as you have candour, and I\\r\\nshall not despair of your becoming everything that I could wish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Cecilia\\'s countenance brightened, and she ran up the steps in almost\\r\\nas high spirits as she ran down them in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-night to you, Cecilia,\" said Mrs. Villars, as she was crossing the\\r\\nhall.  \"Good-night to you, madam,\" said Cecilia; and she ran upstairs to\\r\\nbed.  She could not go to sleep; but she lay awake, reflecting upon the\\r\\nevents of the preceding day, and forming resolutions for the future, at\\r\\nthe same time that she had resolved, and resolved without effect, she\\r\\nwished to give her mind some more powerful motive.  Ambition she knew to\\r\\nbe its most powerful incentive.  \"Have I not,\" said she to herself,\\r\\n\"already won the prize of application, and cannot the same application\\r\\nprocure me a much higher prize?  Mrs. Villars said that if the prize had\\r\\nbeen promised to the most amiable, it would not have been given to me.\\r\\nPerhaps it would not yesterday, perhaps it might not to-morrow; but that\\r\\nis no reason that I should despair of ever deserving it.\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn consequence of this reasoning, Cecilia formed a design of proposing to\\r\\nher companions that they should give a prize, the first of the ensuing\\r\\nmonth (the lst of June), to the most amiable.  Mrs. Villars applauded the\\r\\nscheme, and her companions adopted it with the greatest alacrity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let the prize,\" said they, \"be a bracelet of our own hair;\" and\\r\\ninstantly their shining scissors were produced, and each contributed a\\r\\nlock of their hair.  They formed the most beautiful gradation of colours,\\r\\nfrom the palest auburn to the brightest black.  Who was to have the\\r\\nhonour of plaiting them? was now the question.  Caroline begged that she\\r\\nmight, as she could plait very neatly, she said.  Cecilia, however, was\\r\\nequally sure that she could do it much better; and a dispute would have\\r\\ninevitably ensued, if Cecilia, recollecting herself just as her colour\\r\\nrose to scarlet, had not yielded--yielded, with no very good grace\\r\\nindeed, but as well as could be expected for the first time.  For it is\\r\\nhabit which confers ease; and without ease, even in moral actions, there\\r\\ncan be no grace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bracelet was plaited in the neatest manner by Caroline, finished\\r\\nround the edge with silver twist, and on it was worked, in the smallest\\r\\nsilver letters, this motto, \"TO THE MOST AMIABLE.\"  The moment it was\\r\\ncompleted, everybody begged to try it on.  It fastened with little silver\\r\\nclasps, and as it was made large enough for the eldest girls, it was too\\r\\nlarge for the youngest.  Of this they bitterly complained, and\\r\\nunanimously entreated that it might be cut to fit them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How foolish!\" exclaimed Cecilia; \"don\\'t you perceive that if any of you\\r\\nwin it, you have nothing to do but to put the clips a little further from\\r\\nthe edge, but if we get it, we can\\'t make it larger?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true,\" said they; \"but you need not to have called us foolish,\\r\\nCecilia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was by such hasty and unguarded expressions as these that Cecilia\\r\\noffended.  A slight difference in the manner makes a very material one in\\r\\nthe effect.  Cecilia lost more love by general petulance than she could\\r\\ngain by the greatest particular exertions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow far she succeeded in curing herself of this defect--how far she\\r\\nbecame deserving of the bracelet, and to whom the bracelet was given--\\r\\nshall be told in the History of the First of June.\\r\\n\\r\\n                               -----\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First of June was now arrived, and all the young competitors were in\\r\\na state of the most anxious suspense.  Leonora and Cecilia continued to\\r\\nbe the foremost candidates.  Their quarrel had never been finally\\r\\nadjusted, and their different pretensions now retarded all thoughts of a\\r\\nreconciliation.  Cecilia, though she was capable of acknowledging any of\\r\\nher faults in public before all her companions, could not humble herself\\r\\nin private to Leonora.  Leonora was her equal; they were her inferiors,\\r\\nand submission is much easier to a vain mind, where it appears to be\\r\\nvoluntary, than when it is the necessary tribute to justice or candour.\\r\\nSo strongly did Cecilia feel this truth, that she even delayed making any\\r\\napology, or coming to any explanation with Leonora, until success should\\r\\nonce more give her the palm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I win the bracelet, to-day,\" said she to herself, \"I will solicit the\\r\\nreturn of Leonora\\'s friendship; it will be more valuable to me than even\\r\\nthe bracelet, and at such a time, and asked in such a manner, she surely\\r\\ncannot refuse it to me.\"  Animated with this hope of a double triumph,\\r\\nCecilia canvassed with the most zealous activity.  By constant attention\\r\\nand exertion she had considerably abated the violence of her temper, and\\r\\nchanged the course of her habits.  Her powers of pleasing were now\\r\\nexcited, instead of her abilities to excel; and, if her talents appeared\\r\\nless brilliant, her character was acknowledged to be more amiable.  So\\r\\ngreat an influence upon our manners and conduct have the objects of our\\r\\nambition.\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia was now, if possible, more than ever desirous of doing what was\\r\\nright, but she had not yet acquired sufficient fear of doing wrong.  This\\r\\nwas the fundamental error of her mind; it arose in a great measure from\\r\\nher early education.  Her mother died when she was very young; and though\\r\\nher father had supplied her place in the best and kindest manner, he had\\r\\ninsensibly infused into his daughter\\'s mind a portion of that\\r\\nenterprising, independent spirit which he justly deemed essential to the\\r\\ncharacter of her brother.  This brother was some years older than\\r\\nCecilia, but he had always been the favourite companion of her youth.\\r\\nWhat her father\\'s precepts inculcated, his example enforced; and even\\r\\nCecilia\\'s virtues consequently became such as were more estimable in a\\r\\nman than desirable in a female. All small objects and small errors she\\r\\nhad been taught to disregard as trifles; and her impatient disposition\\r\\nwas perpetually leading her into more material faults; yet her candour in\\r\\nconfessing these, she had been suffered to believe, was sufficient\\r\\nreparation and atonement.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonora, on the contrary, who had been educated by her mother in a manner\\r\\nmore suited to her sex, had a character and virtues more peculiar to a\\r\\nfemale.  Her judgment had been early cultivated, and her good sense\\r\\nemployed in the regulation of her conduct.  She had been habituated to\\r\\nthat restraint, which, as a woman, she was to expect in life, and early\\r\\naccustomed to yield.  Compliance in her seemed natural and graceful; yet\\r\\nnotwithstanding the gentleness of her temper, she was in reality more\\r\\nindependent than Cecilia.  She had more reliance upon her own judgment,\\r\\nand more satisfaction in her own approbation.  The uniform kindness of\\r\\nher manner, the consistency and equality of her character, had fixed the\\r\\nesteem and passive love of her companions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy passive love we mean that species of affection which makes us\\r\\nunwilling to offend rather than anxious to oblige, which is more a habit\\r\\nthan an emotion of the mind.  For Cecilia her companions felt active\\r\\nlove, for she was active in showing her love to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nActive love arises spontaneously in the mind, after feeling particular\\r\\ninstances of kindness, without reflection on the past conduct or general\\r\\ncharacter.  It exceeds the merits of its object, and is connected with a\\r\\nfeeling of generosity, rather than with a sense of justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout determining which species of love is the most flattering to\\r\\nothers, we can easily decide which is the most agreeable feeling to our\\r\\nminds.  We give our hearts more credit for being generous than for being\\r\\njust; and we feel more self-complacency when we give our love\\r\\nvoluntarily, than when we yield it as a tribute which we cannot withhold.\\r\\nThough Cecilia\\'s companions might not know all this in theory, they\\r\\nproved it in practice; for they loved her in a much higher proportion to\\r\\nher merits than they loved Leonora.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach of the young judges were to signify their choice by putting a red or\\r\\na white shell into a vase prepared for the purpose.  Cecilia\\'s colour was\\r\\nred, Leonora\\'s white.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning nothing was to be seen but these shells; nothing talked of\\r\\nbut the long expected event of the evening.  Cecilia, following Leonora\\'s\\r\\nexample, had made it a point of honour not to inquire of any individual\\r\\nher vote, previously to their final determination.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were both sitting together in Louisa\\'s room.  Louisa was recovering\\r\\nfrom the measles.  Everyone during her illness had been desirous of\\r\\nattending her; but Leonora and Cecilia were the only two that were\\r\\npermitted to see her, as they alone had had the distemper.  They were\\r\\nboth assiduous in their care of Louisa, but Leonora\\'s want of exertion to\\r\\novercome any disagreeable feelings of sensibility often deprived her of\\r\\npresence of mind, and prevented her from being so constantly useful as\\r\\nCecilia.  Cecilia, on the contrary, often made too much noise and bustle\\r\\nwith her officious assistance, and was too anxious to invent amusements\\r\\nand procure comforts for Louisa, without perceiving that illness takes\\r\\naway the power of enjoying them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she was sitting at the window in the morning, exerting herself to\\r\\nentertain Louisa, she heard the voice of an old peddler who often used to\\r\\ncome to the house.  Downstairs they ran immediately, to ask Mrs. Villars\\'\\r\\npermission to bring him into the hall.  Mrs. Villars consented, and away\\r\\nCecilia ran to proclaim the news to her companions.  Then, first\\r\\nreturning into the hall, she found the peddler just unbuckling his box,\\r\\nand taking it off his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What would you be pleased to want, miss?\" said the peddler; \"I\\'ve all\\r\\nkinds of tweezer-cases, rings, and lockets of all sorts,\" continued he,\\r\\nopening all the glittering drawers successively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" said Cecilia, shutting the drawer of lockets which tempted her\\r\\nmost, \"these are not the things which I want.  Have you any china\\r\\nfigures? any mandarins?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Alack-a-day, miss, I had a great stock of that same chinaware; but now\\r\\nI\\'m quite out of them kind of things; but I believe,\" said he, rummaging\\r\\none of the deepest drawers, \"I believe I have one left, and here it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that is the very thing! what\\'s its price?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only three shillings, ma\\'am.\"  Cecilia paid the money, and was just\\r\\ngoing to carry off the mandarin, when the peddler took out of his great-\\r\\ncoat pocket a neat mahogany case.  It was about a foot long, and fastened\\r\\nat each end by two little clasps.  It had besides, a small lock in the\\r\\nmiddle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is that?\" said Cecilia, eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s only a china figure, miss, which I am going to carry to an elderly\\r\\nlady, who lives nigh hand, and who is mighty fond of such things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Could you let me look at it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And welcome, miss,\" said he, and opened the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, goodness! how beautiful!\" exclaimed Cecilia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a figure of Flora, crowned with roses, and carrying a basket of\\r\\nflowers in her hand.  Cecilia contemplated it with delight.  \"How I\\r\\nshould like to give this to Louisa!\" said she to herself; and, at last,\\r\\nbreaking silence, \"Did you promise it to the old lady?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no, miss, I didn\\'t promise it--she never saw it; and if so be that\\r\\nyou\\'d like to take it, I\\'d make no more words about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how much does it cost?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, miss, as to that, I\\'ll let you have it for half-a-guinea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia immediately produced the box in which she kept her treasure, and,\\r\\nemptying it upon the table, she began to count the shillings.  Alas!\\r\\nthere were but six shillings.  \"How provoking!\" said she; \"then I can\\'t\\r\\nhave it.  Where\\'s the mandarin?  Oh, I have it,\" said she, taking it up,\\r\\nand looking at it with the utmost disgust.  \"Is this the same that I had\\r\\nbefore?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, miss, the very same,\" replied the peddler, who, during this time,\\r\\nhad been examining the little box out of which Cecilia had taken her\\r\\nmoney--it was of silver.  \"Why, ma\\'am,\" said he, \"since you\\'ve taken such\\r\\na fancy to the piece, if you\\'ve a mind to make up the remainder of the\\r\\nmoney, I will take this here little box, if you care to part with it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow this box was a keepsake from Leonora to Cecilia.  \"No,\" said Cecilia\\r\\nhastily, blushing a little, and stretching out her hand to receive it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, miss!\" said he, returning it carelessly, \"I hope there\\'s no offence.\\r\\nI meant but to serve you, that\\'s all.  Such a rare piece of china-work\\r\\nhas no cause to go a-begging,\" added he.  Then, putting the Flora\\r\\ndeliberately into the case, and turning the key with a jerk, he let it\\r\\ndrop into his pocket; when, lifting up his box by the leather straps, he\\r\\nwas preparing to depart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, stay one minute!\" said Cecilia, in whose mind there had passed a\\r\\nvery warm conflict during the peddler\\'s harangue.  \"Louisa would so like\\r\\nthis Flora,\" said she, arguing with herself.  \"Besides, it would be so\\r\\ngenerous in me to give it to her instead of that ugly mandarin; that\\r\\nwould be doing only common justice, for I promised it to her, and she\\r\\nexpects it.  Though, when I come to look at this mandarin, it is not even\\r\\nso good as hers was.  The gilding is all rubbed off, so that I absolutely\\r\\nmust buy this for her.  Oh, yes! I will, and she will be so delighted!\\r\\nand then everybody will say it is the prettiest thing they ever saw, and\\r\\nthe broken mandarin will be forgotten for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Cecilia\\'s hand moved, and she was just going to decide:  \"Oh, but\\r\\nstop,\" said she to herself, \"consider--Leonora gave me this box, and it\\r\\nis a keepsake.  However, we have now quarrelled, and I dare say that she\\r\\nwould not mind my parting with it.  I\\'m sure that I should not care if\\r\\nshe was to give away my keepsake, the smelling-bottle, or the ring which\\r\\nI gave her.  Then what does it signify?  Besides, is it not my own? and\\r\\nhave I not a right to do what I please with it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment, so critical for Cecilia, a party of her companions opened\\r\\nthe door.  She knew that they came as purchasers, and she dreaded her\\r\\nFlora\\'s becoming the prize of some higher bidder.  \"Here,\" said she,\\r\\nhastily putting the box into the peddler\\'s hand, without looking at it;\\r\\n\"take it, and give me the Flora.\"  Her hand trembled, though she snatched\\r\\nit impatiently.  She ran by, without seeming to mind any of her\\r\\ncompanions.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet those who are tempted to do wrong by the hopes of future\\r\\ngratification, or the prospect of certain concealment and impunity,\\r\\nremember that, unless they are totally depraved, they bear in their own\\r\\nhearts a monitor, who will prevent their enjoying what they ill obtained.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain Cecilia ran to the rest of her companions, to display her\\r\\npresent, in hopes that the applause of others would restore her own self-\\r\\ncomplacency; in vain she saw the Flora pass in due pomp from hand to\\r\\nhand, each vying with the other in extolling the beauty of the gift and\\r\\nthe generosity of the giver.  Cecilia was still displeased with herself,\\r\\nwith them, and even with their praise.  From Louisa\\'s gratitude, however,\\r\\nshe yet expected much pleasure, and immediately she ran upstairs to her\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, Leonora had gone into the hall to buy a bodkin; she had\\r\\njust broken hers.  In giving her change, the peddler took out of his\\r\\npocket, with some halfpence, the very box which Cecilia had sold to him.\\r\\nLeonora did not in the least suspect the truth, for her mind was above\\r\\nsuspicion; and besides, she had the utmost confidence in Cecilia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like to have that box,\" said she, \"for it is like one of which\\r\\nI was very fond.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peddler named the price, and Leonora took the box.  She intended to\\r\\ngive it to little Louisa.  On going to her room she found her asleep, and\\r\\nshe sat softly down by her bedside.  Louisa opened her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope I didn\\'t disturb you,\" said Leonora.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no.  I didn\\'t hear you come in; but what have you got there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only a little box; would you like to have it?  I bought on purpose for\\r\\nyou, as I thought perhaps it would please you, because it\\'s like that\\r\\nwhich I gave Cecilia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! that out of which she used to give me Barbary drops.  I am very\\r\\nmuch obliged to you; I always thought that exceedingly pretty, and this,\\r\\nindeed, is as like it as possible.  I can\\'t unscrew it; will you try?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonora unscrewed it.  \"Goodness!\" exclaimed Louisa, \"this must be\\r\\nCecilia\\'s box.  Look, don\\'t you see a great L at the bottom of it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonora\\'s colour changed.  \"Yes,\" she replied calmly, \"I see that; but it\\r\\nis no proof that it is Cecilia\\'s.  You know that I bought this box just\\r\\nnow of the peddler.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That may be,\" said Louisa; \"but I remember scratching that L with my own\\r\\nneedle, and Cecilia scolded me for it, too.  Do go and ask her if she has\\r\\nlost her box--do,\" repeated Louisa, pulling her by the ruffle, as she did\\r\\nnot seem to listen.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonora, indeed, did not hear, for she was lost in thought.  She was\\r\\ncomparing circumstances, which had before escaped her attention.  She\\r\\nrecollected that Cecilia had passed her as she came into the hall,\\r\\nwithout seeming to see her, but had blushed as she passed.  She\\r\\nremembered that the peddler appeared unwilling to part with the box, and\\r\\nwas going to put it again in his pocket with the halfpence.  \"And why\\r\\nshould he keep it in his pocket, and not show it with his other things?\"\\r\\nCombining all these circumstances, Leonora had no longer any doubt of the\\r\\ntruth, for though she had honourable confidence in her friends, she had\\r\\ntoo much penetration to be implicitly credulous.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Louisa,\" she began, but at this instant she heard a step, which, by its\\r\\nquickness, she knew to be Cecilia\\'s, coming along the passage.  \"If you\\r\\nlove me, Louisa,\" said Leonora, \"say nothing about the box.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, but why not?  I daresay she had lost it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear, I\\'m afraid she has not.\"  Louisa looked surprised.  \"But I\\r\\nhave reasons for desiring you not to say anything about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, I won\\'t, indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia opened the door, came forward smiling, as if secure of a good\\r\\nreception, and taking the Flora out of the case, she placed it on the\\r\\nmantlepiece, opposite to Louisa\\'s bed.  \"Dear, how beautiful!\" cried\\r\\nLouisa, starting up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Cecilia, \"and guess who it\\'s for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For me, perhaps!\" said the ingenuous Louisa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, take it, and keep it, for my sake.  You know that I broke your\\r\\nmandarin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, but this is a great deal prettier and larger than that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I know it is; and I meant that it should be so.  I should only have\\r\\ndone what I was bound to do if I had only given you a mandarin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" replied Louisa, \"and that would have been enough, surely; but\\r\\nwhat a beautiful crown of roses! and then that basket of flowers! they\\r\\nalmost look as if I could smell them.  Dear Cecilia, I\\'m very much\\r\\nobliged to you; but I won\\'t take it by way of payment for the mandarin\\r\\nyou broke; for I\\'m sure you could not help that, and, besides, I should\\r\\nhave broken it myself by this time.  You shall give it to me entirely;\\r\\nand as your keepsake, I\\'ll keep it as long as I live.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLouisa stopped short and coloured; the word keepsake recalled the box to\\r\\nher mind, and all the train of ideas which the Flora had banished.\\r\\n\"But,\" said she, looking up wistfully in Cecilia\\'s face, and holding the\\r\\nFlora doubtfully, \"did you--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonora, who was just quitting the room, turned her head back, and gave\\r\\nLouisa a look, which silenced her.\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia was so infatuated with her vanity, that she neither perceived\\r\\nLeonora\\'s sign nor Louisa\\'s confusion, but continued showing off her\\r\\npresent, by placing it in various situations, till at length she put it\\r\\ninto the case, and laying it down with an affected carelessness upon the\\r\\nbed, \"I must go now, Louisa.  Good-bye,\" said she, running up and kissing\\r\\nher; \"but I\\'ll come again presently,\" then, clapping the door after her\\r\\nshe went.  But as soon as the formentation of her spirits subsided, the\\r\\nsense of shame, which had been scarcely felt when mixed with so many\\r\\nother sensations, rose uppermost in her mind.  \"What!\" said she to\\r\\nherself, \"is it possible that I have sold what I promised to keep for\\r\\never? and what Leonora gave me?  and I have concealed it too, and have\\r\\nbeen making a parade of my generosity.  Oh! what would Leonora, what\\r\\nwould Louisa--what would everybody think of me, if the truth were known?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHumiliated and grieved by these reflections, Cecilia began to search in\\r\\nher own mind for some consoling idea.  She began to compare her conduct\\r\\nwith that of others of her own age; and at length, fixing her comparison\\r\\nupon her brother George, as the companion of whom, from her infancy, she\\r\\nhad been habitually the most emulous, she recollected that an almost\\r\\nsimilar circumstance had once happened to him, and that he had not only\\r\\nescaped disgrace, but had acquired glory, by an intrepid confession of\\r\\nhis fault.  Her father\\'s word to her brother, on the occasion, she also\\r\\nperfectly recollected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come to me, George,\" he said holding out his hand, \"you are a generous,\\r\\nbrave boy:  they who dare to confess their faults will make great and\\r\\ngood men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were his words; but Cecilia, in repeating them to herself, forgot\\r\\nto lay that emphasis on the word MEN, which would have placed it in\\r\\ncontradistinction to the word WOMEN.  She willingly believed that the\\r\\nobservation extended equally to both sexes, and flattered herself that\\r\\nshe should exceed her brother in merit if she owned a fault, which she\\r\\nthought that it would be so much more difficult to confess.  \"Yes, but,\"\\r\\nsaid she, stopping herself, \"how can I confess it?  This very evening, in\\r\\na few hours, the prize will be decided.  Leonora or I shall win it.  I\\r\\nhave now as good a chance as Leonora, perhaps a better; and must I give\\r\\nup all my hopes--all that I have been labouring for this month past?  Oh,\\r\\nI never can!  If it were but to-morrow, or yesterday, or any day but\\r\\nthis, I would not hesitate; but now I am almost certain of the prize, and\\r\\nif I win it--well, why then I will--I think I will tell all--yes I will;\\r\\nI am determined,\" said Cecilia.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere a bell summoned them to dinner.  Leonora sat opposite to her, and\\r\\nshe was not a little surprised to see Cecilia look so gay and\\r\\nunconstrained.  \"Surely,\" said she to herself, \"if Cecilia had done that\\r\\nwhich I suspect, she would not, she could not, look as she does.\"  But\\r\\nLeonora little knew the cause of her gaiety.  Cecilia was never in higher\\r\\nspirits, or better pleased with herself, than when she had resolved upon\\r\\na sacrifice or a confession.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Must not this evening be given to the most amiable?  Whose, then, will\\r\\nit be?\"  All eyes glanced first at Cecilia, and then at Leonora.  Cecilia\\r\\nsmiled; Leonora blushed.  \"I see that it is not yet decided,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nVillars; and immediately they ran upstairs, amidst confused whisperings.\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia\\'s voice could be distinguished far above the rest.  \"How can she\\r\\nbe so happy!\" said Leonora to herself.  \"Oh Cecilia, there was a time\\r\\nwhen you could not have neglected me so! when we were always together the\\r\\nbest of friends and companions; our wishes, tastes, and pleasures the\\r\\nsame!  Surely she did once love me,\" said Leonora; \"but now she is quite\\r\\nchanged.  She has even sold my keepsake; and she would rather win a\\r\\nbracelet of hair from girls whom she did not always think so much\\r\\nsuperior to Leonora, than have my esteem, my confidence, and my\\r\\nfriendship for her whole life--yes, for her whole life, for I am sure she\\r\\nwill be an amiable woman.  Oh, that this bracelet had never been thought\\r\\nof, or that I were certain of her winning it; for I am sure that I do not\\r\\nwish to win it from her.  I would rather--a thousand times rather--that\\r\\nwe were as we used to be than have all the glory in the world.  And how\\r\\npleasing Cecilia can be when she wishes to please!--how candid she is!--\\r\\nhow much she can improve herself!  Let me be just, though she has\\r\\noffended me; she is wonderfully improved within this last month.  For one\\r\\nfault, and THAT against myself, shall I forget all her merits?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Leonora said these last words, she could but just hear the voices of\\r\\nher companions.  They had left her alone in the gallery.  She knocked\\r\\nsoftly at Louisa\\'s door.  \"Come in,\" said Louisa; \"I\\'m not asleep.  Oh,\"\\r\\nsaid she, starting up with the Flora in her hand, the instant that the\\r\\ndoor was opened; \"I\\'m so glad you are come, Leonora, for I did so long to\\r\\nhear what you all were making such a noise about.  Have you forgot that\\r\\nthe bracelet--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! is this the evening?\" inquired Leonora.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, here\\'s my white shell for you,\" said Louisa.  \"I\\'ve kept it in my\\r\\npocket this fortnight; and though Cecilia did give me this Flora, I still\\r\\nlove you a great deal better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thank you, Louisa,\" said Leonora, gratefully.  \"I will take your\\r\\nshell, and I shall value it as long as I live; but here is a red one, and\\r\\nif you wish to show me that you love me, you will give this to Cecilia.\\r\\nI know that she is particularly anxious for your preference, and I am\\r\\nsure that she deserves it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, if I could I would choose both of you,\" said Louisa, \"but you know\\r\\nI can only choose which I like the best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you mean, my dear Louisa,\" said Leonora, \"that you like me the best,\\r\\nI am very much obliged to you, for, indeed, I wish you to love me; but it\\r\\nis enough for me to know it in private.  I should not feel the least more\\r\\npleasure at hearing it in public, or in having it made known to all my\\r\\ncompanions, especially at a time when it would give poor Cecilia a great\\r\\ndeal of pain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why should it give her pain?\" asked Louisa; \"I don\\'t like her for\\r\\nbeing jealous of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, Louisa, surely you don\\'t think Cecilia jealous?  She only tries to\\r\\nexcel, and to please; she is more anxious to succeed than I am, it is\\r\\ntrue, because she has a great deal more activity, and perhaps more\\r\\nambition.  And it would really mortify her to lose this prize--you know\\r\\nthat she proposed it herself.  It has been her object for this month\\r\\npast, and I am sure she has taken great pains to obtain it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, dear Leonora, why should you lose it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, my dear, it would be no loss to me; and, if it were, I would\\r\\nwillingly suffer it for Cecilia; for, though we seem not to be such good\\r\\nfriends as we used to be, I love her very much, and she will love me\\r\\nagain--I\\'m sure she will; when she no longer fears me as a rival, she\\r\\nwill again love me as a friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Leonora heard a number of her companions running along the gallery.\\r\\nThey all knocked hastily at the door, calling \"Leonora! Leonora! will you\\r\\nnever come?  Cecilia has been with us this half-hour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonora smiled.  \"Well, Louisa,\" said she, smiling, \"will you promise\\r\\nme?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I am sure, by the way they speak to you, that they won\\'t give you\\r\\nthe prize!\" said the little Louisa, and the tears started into her eyes.\\r\\n\"They love me, though, for all that,\" said Leonora; \"and as for the\\r\\nprize, you know whom I wish to have it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leonora! Leonora!\" called her impatient companions; \"don\\'t you hear us?\\r\\nWhat are you about?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, she never will take any trouble about anything,\" said one of the\\r\\nparty; \"let\\'s go away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, go, go! make haste!\" cried Louisa; \"don\\'t stay; they are so angry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember, then, that you have promised me,\" said Leonora, and she left\\r\\nthe room.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring all this time, Cecilia had been in the garden with her companions.\\r\\nThe ambition which she had felt to win the first prize--the prize of\\r\\nsuperior talents and superior application--was not to be compared to the\\r\\nabsolute anxiety which she now expressed to win this simple testimony of\\r\\nthe love and approbation of her equals and rivals.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo employ her exuberant activity, Cecilia had been dragging branches of\\r\\nlilacs and laburnums, roses and sweet briar, to ornament the bower in\\r\\nwhich her fate was to be decided.  It was excessively hot, but her mind\\r\\nwas engaged, and she was indefatigable.  She stood still at last to\\r\\nadmire her works.  Her companions all joined in loud applause.  They were\\r\\nnot a little prejudiced in her favour by the great eagerness which she\\r\\nexpressed to win their prize, and by the great importance which she\\r\\nseemed to affix to the preference of each individual.  At last, \"Where is\\r\\nLeonora?\" cried one of them; and immediately, as we have seen, they ran\\r\\nto call her.\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia was left alone.  Overcome with heat and too violent exertion, she\\r\\nhad hardly strength to support herself; each moment appeared to her\\r\\nintolerably long.  She was in a state of the utmost suspense, and all her\\r\\ncourage failed her.  Even hope forsook her; and hope is a cordial which\\r\\nleaves the mind depressed and enfeebled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The time is now come,\" said Cecilia; \"in a few moments all will be\\r\\ndecided.  In a few moments--goodness!  How much do I hazard?  If I should\\r\\nnot win the prize, how shall I confess what I have done?  How shall I beg\\r\\nLeonora to forgive me?  I, who hoped to restore my friendship to her as\\r\\nan honour!  They are gone to seek for her.  The moment she appears I\\r\\nshall be forgotten.  What--what shall I do?\" said Cecilia, covering her\\r\\nface with her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was Cecilia\\'s situation when Leonora, accompanied by her companions,\\r\\nopened the hall door.  They most of them ran forwards to Cecilia.  As\\r\\nLeonora came into the bower, she held out her hand to Cecilia.  \"We are\\r\\nnot rivals, but friends, I hope,\" said she.  Cecilia clasped her hand;\\r\\nbut she was in too great agitation to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table was now set in the arbour--the vase was now placed in the\\r\\nmiddle.  \"Well!\" said Cecilia, eagerly, \"who begins?\"  Caroline, one of\\r\\nher friends, came forward first, and then all the others successively.\\r\\nCecilia\\'s emotion was hardly conceivable.  \"Now they are all in!  Count\\r\\nthem, Caroline!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One, two, three, four; the numbers are both equal.\"  There was a dead\\r\\nsilence.  \"No, they are not,\" exclaimed Cecilia, pressing forward, and\\r\\nputting a shell into a vase.  \"I have not given mine, and I give it to\\r\\nLeonora.\"  Then, snatching the bracelet, \"It is yours, Leonora,\" said\\r\\nshe; \"take it, and give me back your friendship.\"  The whole assembly\\r\\ngave one universal clap and a general shout of applause.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot be surprised at this from you, Cecilia,\" said Leonora; \"and do\\r\\nyou then still love me as you used to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Leonora, stop! don\\'t praise me; I don\\'t deserve this,\" said she,\\r\\nturning to her loudly applauding companions.  \"You will soon despise me.\\r\\nOh, Leonora, you will never forgive me!  I have deceived you; I have\\r\\nsold--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant, Mrs. Villars appeared.  The crowd divided.  She had\\r\\nheard all that passed, from her window.  \"I applaud your generosity,\\r\\nCecilia,\" said she, \"but I am to tell you that, in this instance it is\\r\\nunsuccessful.  You have not it in your power to give the prize to\\r\\nLeonora.  It is yours.  I have another vote to give to you.  You have\\r\\nforgotten Louisa.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Louisa!\" exclaimed Cecilia; \"but surely, ma\\'am, Louisa loves Leonora\\r\\nbetter than she does me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She commissioned me, however,\" said Mrs. Villars, \"to give you a red\\r\\nshell; and you will find it in this box.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia started, and turned as pale as death; it was the fatal box!\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Villars produced another box.  She opened it; it contained the\\r\\nFlora.  \"And Louisa also desired me,\" said she, \"to return to you this\\r\\nFlora.\"  She put it into Cecilia\\'s hand.  Cecilia trembled so that she\\r\\ncould not hold it.  Leonora caught it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, madam!  Oh, Leonora!\" exclaimed Cecilia; \"now I have no hope left.\\r\\nI intended--I was just going to tell--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear Cecilia,\" said Leonora, \"you need not tell it me; I know it\\r\\nalready; and I forgive you with all my heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I can prove to you,\" said Mrs. Villars, \"that Leonora has forgiven\\r\\nyou.  It is she who has given you the prize; it was she who persuaded\\r\\nLouisa to give you her vote.  I went to see her a little while ago; and\\r\\nperceiving, by her countenance, that something was the matter, I pressed\\r\\nher to tell me what it was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Why, madam,\\' said she, \\'Leonora has made me promise to give my shell to\\r\\nCecilia.  Now I don\\'t love Cecilia half so well as I do Leonora.\\r\\nBesides, I would not have Cecilia think I vote for her because she gave\\r\\nme a Flora.\\'  Whilst Louisa was speaking,\" continued Mrs. Villars, \"I saw\\r\\nthis silver box lying on the bed.  I took it up, and asked if it was not\\r\\nyours, and how she came by it.  \\'Indeed, madam,\\' said Louisa, \\'I could\\r\\nhave been almost certain that it was Cecilia\\'s; but Leonora gave it me,\\r\\nand she said that she bought it of the peddler this morning.  If anybody\\r\\nelse had told me so, I could not have believed them, because I remember\\r\\nthe box so well; but I can\\'t help believing Leonora.\\'  But did not you\\r\\nask Cecilia about it? said I.  \\'No, madam,\\' replied Louisa; \\'for Leonora\\r\\nforbade me.  I guessed her reason.\\'  Well, said I, give me the box, and I\\r\\nwill carry your shell in it to Cecilia.  \\'Then, madam,\\' said she, \\'if I\\r\\nmust give it her, pray do take the Flora, and return it to her first,\\r\\nthat she may not think it is for that I do it.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, generous Louisa!\" exclaimed Cecilia; \"but, indeed, Leonora, I cannot\\r\\ntake your shell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, dear Cecilia, accept of mine instead of it! you cannot refuse it;\\r\\nI only follow your example.  As for the bracelet,\" added Leonora, taking\\r\\nCecilia\\'s hand, \"I assure you I don\\'t wish for it, and you do, and you\\r\\ndeserve it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Cecilia, \"indeed, I do not deserve it.  Next to you, surely\\r\\nLouisa deserves it best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Louisa! oh, yes, Louisa,\" exclaimed everybody with one voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Villars, \"and let Cecilia carry the bracelet to her; she\\r\\ndeserves that reward.  For one fault I cannot forget all your merits,\\r\\nCecilia, nor, I am sure, will your companions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, surely, not your best friend,\" said Leonora, kissing her.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody present was moved.  They looked up to Leonora with respectful\\r\\nand affectionate admiration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Leonora, how I love you! and how I wish to be like you!\" exclaimed\\r\\nCecilia--\"to be as good, as generous!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rather wish, Cecilia,\" interrupted Mrs. Villars, \"to be as just; to be\\r\\nas strictly honourable, and as invariably consistent.  Remember, that\\r\\nmany of our sex are capable of great efforts--of making what they call\\r\\ngreat sacrifices to virtue or to friendship; but few treat their friends\\r\\nwith habitual gentleness, or uniformly conduct themselves with prudence\\r\\nand good sense.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE MERCHANTS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Chi di gallina nasce, convien che rozole.\\r\\n     As the old cock crows, so crows the young.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who have visited Italy give us an agreeable picture of the cheerful\\r\\nindustry of the children of all ages in the celebrated city of Naples.\\r\\nTheir manner of living and their numerous employments are exactly\\r\\ndescribed in the following \"Extract from a Traveller\\'s Journal.\" *\\r\\n\\r\\n* Varieties of Literature, vol. i. p. 299.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The children are busied in various ways.  A great number of them bring\\r\\nfish for sale to town from Santa Lucia; others are very often seen about\\r\\nthe arsenals, or wherever carpenters are at work, employed in gathering\\r\\nup the chips and pieces of wood; or by the sea-side, picking up sticks,\\r\\nand whatever else has drifted ashore, which, when their basket is full,\\r\\nthey carry away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Children of two or three years old, who can scarcely crawl along upon\\r\\nthe ground, in company with boys of five or six, are employed in this\\r\\npretty trade.  Hence they proceed with their baskets into the heart of\\r\\nthe city, where in several places they form a sort of little market,\\r\\nsitting round with their stock of wood before them.  Labourers, and the\\r\\nlower order of citizens, buy it of them to burn in the tripods for\\r\\nwarming themselves, or to use in their scanty kitchens.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Other children carry about for sale the water of the sulphurous wells,\\r\\nwhich, particularly in the spring season, is drunk in great abundance.\\r\\nOthers again endeavour to turn a few pence by buying a small matter of\\r\\nfruit, of pressed honey, cakes, and comfits, and then, like little\\r\\npeddlers, offer and sell them to other children, always for no more\\r\\nprofit than that they may have their share of them free of expense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is really curious to see how an urchin, whose whole stock and\\r\\nproperty consist in a board and a knife, will carry about a water-melon,\\r\\nor a half roasted gourd, collect a troup of children round him, set down\\r\\nhis board, and proceed to divide the fruit into small pieces among them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The buyers keep a sharp look out to see that they have enough for their\\r\\nlittle piece of copper; and the Lilliputian tradesmen act with no less\\r\\ncaution as the exigencies of the case may require, to prevent his being\\r\\ncheated out of a morsel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe advantages of truth and honesty, and the value of a character for\\r\\nintegrity, are very early felt amongst these little merchants in their\\r\\ndaily intercourse with each other.  The fair dealer is always sooner or\\r\\nlater seen to prosper.  The most cunning cheat is at last detected and\\r\\ndisgraced.\\r\\n\\r\\nNumerous instances of the truth of this common observation were remarked\\r\\nby many Neapolitan children, especially by those who were acquainted with\\r\\nthe characters and history of Piedro and Francisco, two boys originally\\r\\nequal in birth, fortune and capacity, but different in their education,\\r\\nand consequently in their habits and conduct.  Francisco was the son of\\r\\nan honest gardener, who, from the time he could speak, taught him to love\\r\\nto speak the truth, showed him that liars are never believed--that cheats\\r\\nand thieves cannot be trusted, and that the shortest way to obtain a good\\r\\ncharacter is to deserve it.\\r\\n\\r\\nYouth and white paper, as the proverb says, take all impressions.  The\\r\\nboy profited much by his father\\'s precepts, and more by his example; he\\r\\nalways heard his father speak the truth, and saw that he dealt fairly\\r\\nwith everybody.  In all his childish traffic, Francisco, imitating his\\r\\nparents, was scrupulously honest, and therefore all his companions\\r\\ntrusted him--\"As honest as Francisco,\" became a sort of proverb amongst\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As honest as Francisco,\" repeated Piedro\\'s father, when he one day heard\\r\\nthis saying.  \"Let them say so; I say, \\'As sharp as Piedro\\'; and let us\\r\\nsee which will go through the world best.\"  With the idea of making his\\r\\nson SHARP he made him cunning.  He taught him, that to make a GOOD\\r\\nBARGAIN was to deceive as to the value and price of whatever he wanted to\\r\\ndispose of; to get as much money as possible from customers by taking\\r\\nadvantage of their ignorance or of their confidence.  He often repeated\\r\\nhis favourite proverb--\"The buyer has need of a hundred eyes; the seller\\r\\nhas need but of one.\" *  And he took frequent opportunities of explaining\\r\\nthe meaning of this maxim to his son.  He was a fisherman; and as his\\r\\ngains depended more upon fortune than upon prudence, he trusted\\r\\nhabitually to his good luck.  After being idle for a whole day, he would\\r\\ncast his line or his nets, and if he was lucky enough to catch a fine\\r\\nfish, he would go and show it in triumph to his neighbour the gardener.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Chi compra ha bisogna di cent\\' occhi; chi vende n\\'ha assai di uno.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are obliged to work all day long for your daily bread,\" he would\\r\\nsay.  \"Look here; I work but five minutes, and I have not only daily\\r\\nbread, but daily fish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon these occasions, our fisherman always forgot, or neglected to count,\\r\\nthe hours and days which were wasted in waiting for a fair wind to put to\\r\\nsea, or angling in vain on the shore.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Piedro, who used to bask in the sun upon the sea-shore beside his\\r\\nfather, and to lounge or sleep away his time in a fishing-boat, acquired\\r\\nhabits of idleness, which seemed to his father of little consequence\\r\\nwhilst he was BUT A CHILD.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What will you do with Piedro as he grows up, neighbour?\" said the\\r\\ngardener.  \"He is smart and quick enough, but he is always in mischief.\\r\\nScarcely a day has passed for this fortnight but I have caught him\\r\\namongst my grapes.  I track his footsteps all over my vineyard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"HE IS BUT A CHILD yet, and knows no better,\" replied the fisherman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if you don\\'t teach him better now he is a child, how will he know\\r\\nwhen he is a man?\" said the gardener.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A mighty noise about a bunch of grapes, truly!\" cried the fisherman:  \"a\\r\\nfew grapes more or less in your vineyard, what does it signify?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I speak for your son\\'s sake, and not for the sake of my grapes,\" said\\r\\nthe gardener; \"and I tell you again, the boy will not do well in the\\r\\nworld, neighbour, if you don\\'t look after him in time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'ll do well enough in the world, you will find,\" answered the\\r\\nfisherman, carelessly.  \"Whenever he casts my nets, they never come up\\r\\nempty.  \\'It is better to be lucky than wise.\\'\" *\\r\\n\\r\\n* E meglio esser fortunato che savio.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a proverb which Piedro had frequently heard from his father, and\\r\\nto which he most willingly trusted, because it gave him less trouble to\\r\\nfancy himself fortunate than to make himself wise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come here, child,\" said his father to him, when he returned home after\\r\\nthe preceding conversation with the gardener; \"how old are you, my boy?--\\r\\ntwelve years old, is not it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As old as Francisco, and older by six months,\" said Piedro.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And smarter and more knowing by six years,\" said his father.  \"Here,\\r\\ntake these fish to Naples, and let us see how you\\'ll sell them for me.\\r\\nVenture a small fish, as the proverb says, to catch a great one. *  I was\\r\\ntoo late with them at the market yesterday, but nobody will know but what\\r\\nthey are just fresh out of the water, unless you go and tell them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n* Butta una sardella per pigliar un luccio.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not I; trust me for that; I\\'m not such a fool,\" replied Piedro,\\r\\nlaughing; \"I leave that to Francisco.  Do you know, I saw him the other\\r\\nday miss selling a melon for his father by turning the bruised side to\\r\\nthe customer, who was just laying down the money for it, and who was a\\r\\nraw servant-boy, moreover--one who would never have guessed there were\\r\\ntwo sides to a melon, if he had not, as you say, father, been told of\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Off with you to market.  You are a droll chap,\" said his father, \"and\\r\\nwill sell my fish cleverly, I\\'ll be bound.  As to the rest, let every man\\r\\ntake care of his own grapes.  You understand me, Piedro?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfectly,\" said the boy, who perceived that his father was indifferent\\r\\nas to his honesty, provided he sold fish at the highest price possible.\\r\\nHe proceeded to the market, and he offered his fish with assiduity to\\r\\nevery person whom he thought likely to buy it, especially to those upon\\r\\nwhom he thought he could impose.  He positively asserted to all who\\r\\nlooked at his fish, that they were just fresh out of the water.  Good\\r\\njudges of men and fish knew that he said what was false, and passed him\\r\\nby with neglect; but it was at last what he called GOOD LUCK to meet with\\r\\nthe very same young raw servant-boy who would have bought the bruised\\r\\nmelon from Francisco.  He made up to him directly, crying, \"Fish!  Fine\\r\\nfresh fish! fresh fish!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was it caught to-day?\" said the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, this morning; not an hour ago,\" said Piedro, with the greatest\\r\\neffrontery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant-boy was imposed upon; and being a foreigner, speaking the\\r\\nItalian language but imperfectly, and not being expert at reckoning the\\r\\nItalian money, he was no match for the cunning Piedro, who cheated him\\r\\nnot only as to the freshness, but as to the price of the commodity.\\r\\nPiedro received nearly half as much again for his fish as he ought to\\r\\nhave done.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his road homewards from Naples to the little village of Resina, where\\r\\nhis father lived, he overtook Francisco, who was leading his father\\'s\\r\\nass.  The ass was laden with large panniers, which were filled with the\\r\\nstalks and leaves of cauliflowers, cabbages, broccoli, lettuces, etc.--\\r\\nall the refuse of the Neapolitan kitchens, which are usually collected by\\r\\nthe gardeners\\' boys, and carried to the gardens round Naples, to be mixed\\r\\nwith other manure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well filled panniers, truly,\" said Piedro, as he overtook Francisco and\\r\\nthe ass.  The panniers were indeed not only filled to the top, but piled\\r\\nup with much skill and care, so that the load met over the animal\\'s back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is not a very heavy load for the ass, though it looks so large,\" said\\r\\nFrancisco.  \"The poor fellow, however, shall have a little of this\\r\\nwater,\" added he, leading the ass to a pool by the roadside.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was not thinking of the ass, boy; I was not thinking of any ass, but\\r\\nof you, when I said, \\'Well filled panniers, truly!\\'  This is your\\r\\nmorning\\'s work, I presume, and you\\'ll make another journey to Naples to-\\r\\nday, on the same errand, I warrant, before your father thinks you have\\r\\ndone enough?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not before MY FATHER thinks I have done enough, but before I think so\\r\\nmyself,\" replied Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do enough to satisfy myself and my father, too,\" said Piedro, \"without\\r\\nslaving myself after your fashion.  Look here,\" producing the money he\\r\\nhad received for the fish; \"all this was had for asking.  It is no bad\\r\\nthing, you\\'ll allow, to know how to ask for money properly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should be ashamed to beg, or borrow either,\" said Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neither did I get what you see by begging, or borrowing either,\" said\\r\\nPiedro, \"but by using my wits; not as you did yesterday, when, like a\\r\\nnovice, you showed the bruised side of your melon, and so spoiled your\\r\\nmarket by your wisdom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wisdom I think it still,\" said Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And your father?\" asked Piedro.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And my father,\" said Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mine is of a different way of thinking,\" said Piedro.  \"He always tells\\r\\nme that the buyer has need of a hundred eyes, and if one can blind the\\r\\nwhole hundred, so much the better.  You must know, I got off the fish to-\\r\\nday that my father could not sell yesterday in the market--got it off for\\r\\nfresh just out of the river--got twice as much as the market price for\\r\\nit; and from whom, think you?  Why, from the very booby that would have\\r\\nbought the bruised melon for a sound one if you would have let him.\\r\\nYou\\'ll allow I\\'m no fool, Francisco, and that I\\'m in a fair way to grow\\r\\nrich, if I go on as I have begun.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stay,\" said Francisco; \"you forgot that the booby you took in to-day\\r\\nwill not be so easily taken in to-morrow.  He will buy no more fish from\\r\\nyou, because he will be afraid of your cheating him; but he will be ready\\r\\nenough to buy fruit from me, because he will know I shall not cheat him--\\r\\nso you\\'ll have lost a customer, and I gained one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With all my heart,\" said Piedro.  \"One customer does not make a market;\\r\\nif he buys no more from me, what care I? there are people enough to buy\\r\\nfish in Naples.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you mean to serve them all in the same manner?\" asked Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If they will be only so good as to give me leave,\" said Piedro,\\r\\nlaughing, and repeating his father\\'s proverb, \"\\'Venture a small fish to\\r\\ncatch a large one.\\'\" *  He had learned to think that to cheat in making\\r\\nbargains was witty and clever.\\r\\n\\r\\n* see anted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you have never considered, then,\" said Francisco, \"that all these\\r\\npeople will, one after another, find you out in time?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, in time; but it will be some time first.  There are a great many of\\r\\nthem, enough to last me all the summer, if I lose a customer a day,\" said\\r\\nPiedro.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And next summer,\" observed Francisco, \"what will you do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Next summer is not come yet; there is time enough to think what I shall\\r\\ndo before next summer comes.  Why, now, suppose the blockheads, after\\r\\nthey had been taken in and found it out, all joined against me, and would\\r\\nbuy none of our fish--what then?  Are there no trades but that of a\\r\\nfisherman?  In Naples, are there not a hundred ways of making money for a\\r\\nsmart lad like me? as my father says.  What do you think of turning\\r\\nmerchant, and selling sugar-plums and cakes to the children in their\\r\\nmarket?  Would they be hard to deal with, think you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think not,\" said Francisco; \"but I think the children would find out\\r\\nin time if they were cheated, and would like it as little as the men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t doubt them.  Then IN TIME I could, you know, change my trade--\\r\\nsell chips and sticks in the wood-market--hand about the lemonade to the\\r\\nfine folks, or twenty other things.  There are trades enough, boy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, for the honest dealer,\" said Francisco, \"but for no other; for in\\r\\nall of them you\\'ll find, as MY father says, that a good character is the\\r\\nbest fortune to set up with.  Change your trade ever so often, you\\'ll be\\r\\nfound out for what you are at last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what am I, pray?\" said Piedro, angrily.  \"The whole truth of the\\r\\nmatter is, Francisco, that you envy my good luck, and can\\'t bear to hear\\r\\nthis money jingle in my hand.  Ay, stroke the long ears of your ass, and\\r\\nlook as wise as you please.  It\\'s better to be lucky than wise, as MY\\r\\nfather says.  Good morning to you.  When I am found out for what I am, or\\r\\nwhen the worst comes to the worst, I can drive a stupid ass, with his\\r\\npanniers filled with rubbish, as well as you do now, HONEST FRANCISCO.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not quite so well.  Unless you were HONEST FRANCISCO, you would not fill\\r\\nhis panniers quite so readily.\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was certain, that Francisco was so well known for his honesty\\r\\namongst all the people at Naples with whom his father was acquainted,\\r\\nthat everyone was glad to deal with him; and as he never wronged anyone,\\r\\nall were willing to serve him--at least, as much as they could without\\r\\nloss to themselves:  so that after the market was over, his panniers were\\r\\nregularly filled by the gardeners and others with whatever he wanted.\\r\\nHis industry was constant, his gains small but certain, and he every day\\r\\nhad more and more reason to trust to his father\\'s maxim--That honesty is\\r\\nthe best policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foreign servant lad, to whom Francisco had so honestly, or, as Piedro\\r\\nsaid, so sillily, shown the bruised side of the melon, was an Englishman.\\r\\nHe left his native country, of which he was extremely fond, to attend\\r\\nupon his master, to whom he was still more attached.  His master was in a\\r\\ndeclining state of health, and this young lad waited on him a little more\\r\\nto his mind than his other servants.  We must, in consideration of his\\r\\nzeal, fidelity and inexperience, pardon him for not being a good judge of\\r\\nfish.  Though he had simplicity enough to be easily cheated once, he had\\r\\ntoo much sense to be twice made a dupe.  The next time he met Piedro in\\r\\nthe market, he happened to be in company with several English gentlemen\\'s\\r\\nservants, and he pointed Piedro out to them all as an arrant knave.  They\\r\\nheard his cry of \"Fresh fish! fresh fish! fine fresh fish!\" with\\r\\nincredulous smiles, and let him pass, but not without some expressions of\\r\\ncontempt, though uttered in English, he tolerably well understood; for\\r\\nthe tone of contempt is sufficiently expressive in all languages.  He\\r\\nlost more by not selling his fish to these people than he had gained the\\r\\nday before by cheating the ENGLISH BOOBY.  The market was well supplied,\\r\\nand he could not get rid of his cargo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is not this truly provoking?\" said Piedro, as he passed by Francisco,\\r\\nwho was selling fruit for his father.  \"Look, my basket is as heavy as\\r\\nwhen I left home and look at \\'em yourself, they really are fine fresh\\r\\nfish to-day and yet, because that revengeful booby told how I took him in\\r\\nyesterday, not one of yonder crowd would buy them; and all the time they\\r\\nreally are fresh to-day!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So they are,\" said Franscisco, \"but you said so yesterday, when they\\r\\nwere not; and he that was duped then, is not ready to believe you to-day.\\r\\nHow does he know that you deserve it better?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He might have looked at the fish,\" repeated Piedro; \"they are fresh to-\\r\\nday.  I am sure he need not have been afraid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay,\" said Francisco; \"but as my father said to you once--the scalded dog\\r\\nfears cold water.\" *\\r\\n\\r\\n* Il cane scottato dell\\' acqua calda ha paura poi della fredda.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere their conversation was interrupted by the same English lad, who\\r\\nsmiled as he came up to Francisco, and taking up a fine pine-apple, he\\r\\nsaid, in a mixture of bad Italian and English--\"I need not look at the\\r\\nother side of this; you will tell me if it is not as good as it looks.\\r\\nName your price; I know you have but one, and that an honest one; and as\\r\\nto the rest, I am able and willing to pay for what I buy; that is to say,\\r\\nmy master is, which comes to the same thing.  I wish your fruit could\\r\\nmake him well, and it would be worth its weight in gold to me, at least.\\r\\nWe must have some of your grapes for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is he not well?\" inquired Francisco.  \"We must, then, pick out the best\\r\\nfor him,\" at the same time singling out a tempting bunch.  \"I hope he\\r\\nwill like these; but if you could some day come as far as Resina (it is a\\r\\nvillage but a few miles out of town, where we have our vineyard), you\\r\\ncould there choose for yourself, and pluck them fresh from the vines for\\r\\nyour poor master.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bless you, my good boy; I should take you for an Englishman, by your way\\r\\nof dealing.  I\\'ll come to your village.  Only write me down the name; for\\r\\nyour Italian names slip through my head.  I\\'ll come to the vineyard if it\\r\\nwas ten miles off; and all the time we stay in Naples (may it not be so\\r\\nlong as I fear it will!), with my master\\'s leave, which he never refuses\\r\\nme to anything that\\'s proper, I\\'ll deal with you for all our fruit, as\\r\\nsure as my name\\'s Arthur, and with none else, with my good will.  I wish\\r\\nall your countrymen would take after you in honesty, indeed I do,\"\\r\\nconcluded the Englishman, looking full at Piedro, who took up his unsold\\r\\nbasket of fish, looking somewhat silly, and gloomily walked off.\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur, the English servant, was as good as his word.  He dealt\\r\\nconstantly with Francisco, and proved an excellent customer, buying from\\r\\nhim during the whole season as much fruit as his master wanted.  His\\r\\nmaster, who was an Englishman of distinction, was invited to take up his\\r\\nresidence, during his stay in Italy, at the Count de F.\\'s villa, which\\r\\nwas in the environs of Naples--an easy walk from Resina.  Francisco had\\r\\nthe pleasure of seeing his father\\'s vineyard often full of generous\\r\\nvisitors, and Arthur, who had circulated the anecdote of the bruised\\r\\nmelon, was, he said, \"proud to think that some of this was his doing, and\\r\\nthat an Englishman never forgot a good turn, be it from a countryman or\\r\\nforeigner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear boy,\" said Francisco\\'s father to him, whilst Arthur was in the\\r\\nvineyard helping to tend the vines, \"I am to thank you and your honesty,\\r\\nit seems, for our having our hands so full of business this season.  It\\r\\nis fair you should have a share of our profits.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I have, father, enough and enough, when I see you and mother going on\\r\\nso well.  What can I want more?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my brave boy, we know you are a grateful, good son; but I have been\\r\\nyour age myself; you have companions, you have little expenses of your\\r\\nown.  Here; this vine, this fig-tree, and a melon a week next summer\\r\\nshall be yours.  With these make a fine figure amongst the little\\r\\nNeapolitan merchants; and all I wish is that you may prosper as well, and\\r\\nby the same honest means, in managing for yourself, as you have done\\r\\nmanaging for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, father; and if I prosper at all, it shall be by those means,\\r\\nand no other, or I should not be worthy to be called your son.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro the cunning did not make quite so successful a summer\\'s work as\\r\\ndid Francisco the honest.  No extraordinary events happened, no singular\\r\\ninstance of bad or good luck occurred; but he felt, as persons usually\\r\\ndo, the natural consequences of his own actions.  He pursued his scheme\\r\\nof imposing, as far as he could, upon every person he dealt with; and the\\r\\nconsequence was, that at last nobody would deal with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is easy to outwit one person, but impossible to outwit all the\\r\\nworld,\" said a man * who knew the world at least as well as either Piedro\\r\\nor his father.\\r\\n\\r\\n* The Duke de Rochefoucault.--\"On peut etre puls fin qu\\'un autre, mais\\r\\npas plus fin que tous les autres.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro\\'s father, amongst others, had reason to complain.  He saw his own\\r\\ncustomers fall off from him, and was told, whenever he went into the\\r\\nmarket, that his son was such a cheat there was no dealing with him.  One\\r\\nday, when he was returning from the market in a very bad humour, in\\r\\nconsequence of these reproaches, and of his not having found customers\\r\\nfor his goods, he espied his SMART son Piedro at a little merchant\\'s\\r\\nfruit-board devouring a fine gourd with prodigious greediness.  \"Where,\\r\\nglutton, do you find money to pay for these dainties?\" exclaimed his\\r\\nfather, coming close up to him, with angry gestures.  Piedro\\'s mouth was\\r\\nmuch too full to make an immediate reply, nor did his father wait for\\r\\nany, but darting his hand into the youth\\'s pocket, pulled forth a handful\\r\\nof silver.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The money, father,\" said Piedro, \"that I got for the fish yesterday, and\\r\\nthat I meant to give you to-day, before you went out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I\\'ll make you remember it against another time, sirrah!\" said his\\r\\nfather.  \"I\\'ll teach you to fill your stomach with my money.  Am I to\\r\\nlose my customers by your tricks, and then find you here eating my all?\\r\\nYou are a rogue, and everybody has found you out to be a rogue; and the\\r\\nworst of rogues I find you, who scruples not to cheat his own father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSaying these words, with great vehemence he seized hold of Piedro, and in\\r\\nthe very midst of the little fruit-market gave him a severe beating.\\r\\nThis beating did the boy no good; it was vengeance not punishment.\\r\\nPiedro saw that his father was in a passion, and knew that he was beaten\\r\\nbecause he was found out to be a rogue, rather than for being one.  He\\r\\nrecollected perfectly that his father once said to him:  \"Let everyone\\r\\ntake care of his own grapes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed it was scarcely reasonable to expect that a boy who had been\\r\\neducated to think that he might cheat every customer he could in the way\\r\\nof trade, should be afterwards scrupulously honest in his conduct towards\\r\\nthe father whose proverbs encouraged his childhood in cunning.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro writhed with bodily pain as he left the market after his drubbing,\\r\\nbut his mind was not in the least amended.  On the contrary, he was\\r\\nhardened to the sense of shame by the loss of reputation.  All the little\\r\\nmerchants were spectators of this scene, and heard his father\\'s words:\\r\\n\"You ARE a rogue, and the worst of rogues, who scruples not to cheat his\\r\\nown father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words were long remembered, and long did Piedro feel their effects.\\r\\nHe once flattered himself that, when his trade of selling fish failed\\r\\nhim, he could readily engage in some other; but he now found, to his\\r\\nmortification, that what Francisco\\'s father said proved true:  \"In all\\r\\ntrades the best fortune to set up with is a good character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNot one of the little Neapolitan merchants would either enter into\\r\\npartnership with him, give him credit, or even trade with him for ready\\r\\nmoney.  \"If you would cheat your own father, to be sure you will cheat\\r\\nus,\" was continually said to him by these prudent little people.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro was taunted and treated with contempt at home and abroad.  His\\r\\nfather, when he found that his son\\'s smartness was no longer useful in\\r\\nmaking bargains, shoved him out of his way whenever he met him.  All the\\r\\nfood or clothes that he had at home seemed to be given to him grudgingly,\\r\\nand with such expressions as these:  \"Take that; but it is too good for\\r\\nyou.  You must eat this, now, instead of gourds and figs--and be thankful\\r\\nyou have even this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro spent a whole winter very unhappily.  He expected that all his old\\r\\ntricks, and especially what his father had said of him in the market-\\r\\nplace, would be soon forgotten; but month passed after month, and still\\r\\nthese things were fresh in the memory of all who had known them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not easy to get rid of a bad character.  A very great rogue * was\\r\\nonce heard to say, that he would, with all his heart, give ten thousand\\r\\npounds for a good character, because he knew that he could make twenty\\r\\nthousand by it.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Chartres.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething like this was the sentiment of our cunning hero when he\\r\\nexperienced the evils of a bad reputation, and when he saw the numerous\\r\\nadvantages which Francisco\\'s good character procured.  Such had been\\r\\nPiedro\\'s wretched education, that even the hard lessons of experience\\r\\ncould not alter its pernicious effects.  He was sorry his knavery had\\r\\nbeen detected, but he still thought it clever to cheat, and was secretly\\r\\npersuaded that, if he had cheated successfully, he should have been\\r\\nhappy.  \"But I know I am not happy now,\" said he to himself one morning,\\r\\nas he sat alone disconsolate by the sea-shore, dressed in tattered\\r\\ngarments, weak and hungry, with an empty basket beside him.  His fishing-\\r\\nrod, which he held between his knees, bent over the dry sands instead of\\r\\ninto the water, for he was not thinking of what he was about; his arms\\r\\nwere folded, his head hung down, and his ragged hat was slouched over his\\r\\nface.  He was a melancholy spectacle.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco, as he was coming from his father\\'s vineyard with a large dish\\r\\nof purple and white grapes upon his head, and a basket of melons and figs\\r\\nhanging upon his arm, chanced to see Piedro seated in this melancholy\\r\\nposture.  Touched with compassion, Francisco approached him softly; his\\r\\nfootsteps were not heard upon the sands, and Piedro did not perceive that\\r\\nanyone was near him till he felt something cold touch his hand; he then\\r\\nstarted, and, looking up, saw a bunch of grapes, which Francisco was\\r\\nholding over his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eat them:  you\\'ll find them very good, I hope,\" said Francisco, with a\\r\\nbenevolent smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are excellent--most excellent, and I am much obliged to you,\\r\\nFrancisco,\" said Piedro.  \"I was very hungry, and that\\'s what I am now,\\r\\nwithout anybody\\'s caring anything about it.  I am not the favourite I was\\r\\nwith my father, but I know it is all my own fault.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, but cheer up,\" said Francisco; \"my father always says, \\'One who\\r\\nknows he has been in fault, and acknowledges it, will scarcely be in\\r\\nfault again.\\'  Yes, take as many figs as you will,\" continued he; and\\r\\nheld his basket closer to Piedro, who, as he saw, cast a hungry eye upon\\r\\none of the ripe figs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" said Piedro, after he had taken several, \"shall not I get you into\\r\\na scrape by taking so many?  Won\\'t your father be apt to miss them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you think I would give them to you if they were not my own?\" said\\r\\nFrancisco, with a sudden glance of indignation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, don\\'t be angry that I asked the question; it was only from fear of\\r\\ngetting you into disgrace that I asked it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would not be easy for anybody to do that, I hope,\" said Francisco,\\r\\nrather proudly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And to me less than anybody,\" replied Piedro, in an insinuating tone,\\r\\n\"_I,_ that am so much obliged to you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A bunch of grapes, and a few figs, are no mighty obligation,\" said\\r\\nFrancisco, smiling; \"I wish I could do more for you.  You seem, indeed,\\r\\nto have been very unhappy of late.  We never see you in the markets as we\\r\\nused to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; ever since my father beat me, and called me rogue before all the\\r\\nchildren there, I have never been able to show my face without being\\r\\ngibed at by one or t\\'other.  If you would but take me along with you\\r\\namongst them, and only just SEEM my friend, for a day or two, or so, it\\r\\nwould quite set me up again; for they all like you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would rather BE than seem your friend, if I could,\" said Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, to be sure; that would be still better,\" said Piedro, observing that\\r\\nFrancisco, as he uttered his last sentence, was separating the grapes and\\r\\nother fruits into two equal divisions.  \"To be sure I would rather you\\r\\nwould BE than SEEM a friend to me; but I thought that was too much to ask\\r\\nat first, though I have a notion, notwithstanding I have been so UNLUCKY\\r\\nlately--I have a notion you would have no reason to repent of it.  You\\r\\nwould find me no bad hand, if you were to try, and take me into\\r\\npartnership.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Partnership!\" interrupted Francisco, drawing back alarmed; \"I had no\\r\\nthoughts of that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But won\\'t you? can\\'t you?\" said Piedro, in a supplicating tone; \"CAN\\'T\\r\\nyou have thoughts of it?  You\\'d find me a very active partner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFranscisco still drew back, and kept his eyes fixed upon the ground.  He\\r\\nwas embarrassed; for he pitied Piedro, and he scarcely knew how to point\\r\\nout to him that something more is necessary in a partner in trade besides\\r\\nactivity, and that is honesty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t you?\" repeated Piedro, thinking that he hesitated from merely\\r\\nmercenary motives.  \"You shall have what share of the profits you\\r\\nplease.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was not thinking of the profits,\" said Francisco;  \"but without\\r\\nmeaning to be ill-natured to you, Piedro, I must say that I cannot enter\\r\\ninto any partnership with you at present; but I will do what, perhaps,\\r\\nyou will like as well,\" said he, taking half the fruit out of his basket;\\r\\n\"you are heartily welcome to this; try and sell it in the children\\'s\\r\\nfruit market.  I\\'ll go on before you, and speak to those I am acquainted\\r\\nwith, and tell them you are going to set up a new character, and that you\\r\\nhope to make it a good one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hey, shall I!  Thank you for ever, dear Francisco,\" cried Piedro,\\r\\nseizing his plentiful gift of fruit.  \"Say what you please for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But don\\'t make me say anything that is not true,\" said Francisco,\\r\\npausing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, to be sure not,\" said Piedro; \"I DO mean to give no room for\\r\\nscandal.  If I could get them to trust me as they do you, I should be\\r\\nhappy indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is what you may do, if you please,\" said Francisco.  \"Adieu, I wish\\r\\nyou well with all my heart; but I must leave you now, or I shall be too\\r\\nlate for the market.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Chi va piano va sano, e anche lontano.\\r\\n     Fair and softly goes far in a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro had now an opportunity of establishing a good character.  When he\\r\\nwent into the market with his grapes and figs, he found that he was not\\r\\nshunned or taunted as usual.  All seemed disposed to believe in his\\r\\nintended reformation, and to give him a fair trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese favourable dispositions towards him were the consequence of\\r\\nFrancisco\\'s benevolent representations.  He told them that he thought\\r\\nPiedro had suffered enough to cure him of his tricks, and that it would\\r\\nbe cruelty in them, because he might once have been in fault, to banish\\r\\nhim by their reproaches from amongst them, and thus to prevent him from\\r\\nthe means of gaining his livelihood honestly.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro made a good beginning, and gave what several of the younger\\r\\ncustomers thought excellent bargains.  His grapes and figs were quickly\\r\\nsold, and with the money that he got for them he the next day purchased\\r\\nfrom a fruit dealer a fresh supply; and thus he went on for some time,\\r\\nconducting himself with scrupulous honesty, so that he acquired some\\r\\ncredit among his companions.  They no longer watched him with suspicious\\r\\neyes.  They trusted to his measures and weights, and they counted less\\r\\ncarefully the change which they received from him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe satisfaction he felt from this alteration in their manners was at\\r\\nfirst delightful to Piedro; but in proportion to his credit, his\\r\\nopportunities of defrauding increased; and these became temptations which\\r\\nhe had not the firmness to resist.  His old manner of thinking recurred.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I make but a few shillings a day, and this is but slow work,\" said he to\\r\\nhimself.  \"What signifies my good character, if I make so little by it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLight gains, and frequent, make a heavy purse, * was one of Francisco\\'s\\r\\nproverbs.  But Piedro was in too great haste to get rich to take time\\r\\ninto his account.  He set his invention to work, and he did not want for\\r\\ningenuity, to devise means of cheating without running the risk of\\r\\ndetection.  He observed that the younger part of the community were\\r\\nextremely fond of certain coloured sugar plums, and of burnt almonds.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Poco e spesso empie il l\\'orsetto.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the money he had earned by two months\\' trading in fruit he laid in a\\r\\nlarge stock of what appeared to these little merchants a stock of almonds\\r\\nand sugar-plums, and he painted in capital gold coloured letters upon his\\r\\nboard, \"Sweetest, largest, most admirable sugar-plums of all colours ever\\r\\nsold in Naples, to be had here; and in gratitude to his numerous\\r\\ncustomers, Piedro adds to these, \\'Burnt almonds gratis.\\'\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThis advertisement attracted the attention of all who could read; and\\r\\nmany who could not read heard it repeated with delight.  Crowds of\\r\\nchildren surrounded Piedro\\'s board of promise, and they all went away the\\r\\nfirst day amply satisfied.  Each had a full measure of coloured sugar-\\r\\nplums at the usual price, and along with these a burnt almond gratis.\\r\\nThe burnt almond had such an effect upon the public judgment, that it was\\r\\nuniversally allowed that the sugar-plums were, as the advertisement set\\r\\nforth, the largest, sweetest, most admirable ever sold in Naples; though\\r\\nall the time they were, in no respect, better than any other sugar-plums.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was generally reported that Piedro gave full measure--fuller than any\\r\\nother board in the city.  He measured the sugar-plums in a little cubical\\r\\ntin box; and this, it was affirmed, he heaped up to the top, and pressed\\r\\ndown before he poured out the contents into the open hands of his\\r\\napproving customers.  This belief, and Piedro\\'s popularity, continued\\r\\nlonger even than he had expected; and, as he thought his sugar-plums had\\r\\nsecured their reputation with the GENEROUS PUBLIC, he gradually neglected\\r\\nto add burnt almonds gratis.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day a boy of about ten years old passed carelessly by, whistling as\\r\\nhe went along, and swinging a carpenter\\'s rule in his hand.  \"Ha! what\\r\\nhave we here?\" cried he, stopping to read what was written on Piedro\\'s\\r\\nboard.  \"This promises rarely.  Old as I am, and tall of my age, which\\r\\nmakes the matter worse, I am still as fond of sugar-plums as my little\\r\\nsister, who is five years younger than I.  Come, Signor, fill me quick,\\r\\nfor I\\'m in haste to taste them, two measures of the sweetest, largest,\\r\\nmost admirable sugar-plums in Naples--one measure for myself and one for\\r\\nmy little Rosetta.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll pay for yourself and your sister, then,\" said Piedro, \"for no\\r\\ncredit is given here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No credit do I ask,\" replied the lively boy; \"when I told you I loved\\r\\nsugar-plums, did I tell you I loved them, or even my sister, so well as\\r\\nto run in debt for them?  Here\\'s for myself, and here\\'s for my sister\\'s\\r\\nshare,\" said he, laying down his money; \"and now for the burnt almonds\\r\\ngratis, my good fellow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are all out; I have been out of burnt almonds this great while,\"\\r\\nsaid Piedro.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then why are they in your advertisement here?\" said Carlo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not had time to scratch them out of the board.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What! not when you have, by your own account, been out of them a great\\r\\nwhile?  I did not know it required so much time to blot out a few words--\\r\\nlet us try.\"; and as he spoke, Carlo, for that was the name of Piedro\\'s\\r\\nnew customer, pulled a bit of white chalk out of his pocket, and drew a\\r\\nbroad score across the line on the board which promised burnt almonds\\r\\ngratis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are most impatient,\" said Piedro; \"I shall have a fresh stock of\\r\\nalmonds to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why must the board tell a lie to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would ruin me to alter it,\" said Piedro.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A lie may ruin you, but I could scarcely think the truth could.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have no right to meddle with me or my board,\" said Piedro, put off\\r\\nhis guard, and out of his usual soft voice of civility, by this last\\r\\nobservation.  \"My character, and that of my board, are too firmly\\r\\nestablished now for any chance customer like you to injure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never dreamed of injuring you or anyone else,\" said Carlo--\"I wish,\\r\\nmoreover, you may not injure yourself.  Do as you please with your board,\\r\\nbut give me my sugar-plums, for I have some right to meddle with those,\\r\\nhaving paid for them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hold out your hand, then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, put them in here, if you please; put my sister\\'s, at least, in here;\\r\\nshe likes to have them in this box:  I bought some for her in it\\r\\nyesterday, and she\\'ll think they\\'ll taste the better out of the same box.\\r\\nBut how is this? your measure does not fill my box nearly; you give us\\r\\nvery few sugar-plums for our money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I give you full measure, as I give to everybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The measure should be an inch cube, I know,\" said Carlo; \"that\\'s what\\r\\nall the little merchants have agreed to, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True,\" said Piedro, \"so it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so it is, I must allow,\" said Carlo, measuring the outside of it\\r\\nwith the carpenter\\'s rule which he held in his hand.  \"An inch every way;\\r\\nand yet by my eye--and I have no bad one, being used to measuring\\r\\ncarpenter\\'s work for my father--by my eye I should think this would have\\r\\nheld more sugar-plums.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The eye often deceives us;\" said Piedro.  \"There\\'s nothing like\\r\\nmeasuring, you find.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s nothing like measuring, I find, indeed,\" replied Carlo, as he\\r\\nlooked closely at the end of his rule, which, since he spoke last, he had\\r\\nput into the cube to take its depth in the inside.  \"This is not as deep\\r\\nby a quarter of an inch, Signor Piedro, measured within as it is measured\\r\\nwithout.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro changed colour terribly, and seizing hold of the tin box,\\r\\nendeavoured to wrest it from the youth who measured so accurately.  Carlo\\r\\nheld his prize fast, and lifting it above his head, he ran into the midst\\r\\nof the square where the little market was held, exclaiming, \"A discovery!\\r\\na discovery! that concerns all who love sugar-plums.  A discovery! a\\r\\ndiscovery that concerns all who have ever bought the sweetest, and most\\r\\nadmirable sugar-plums ever sold in Naples.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd gathered from all parts of the square as he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have bought,\" and \"We have bought of those sugar-plums,\" cried\\r\\nseveral little voices at once, \"if you mean Piedro\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The same,\" continued Carlo--\"he who, out of gratitude to his numerous\\r\\ncustomers, gives, or promises to give, burnt almonds gratis.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Excellent they were!\" cried several voices.  \"We all know Piedro well;\\r\\nbut what\\'s your discovery?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My discovery is,\" said Carlo, \"that you, none of you, know Piedro.  Look\\r\\nyou here; look at this box--this is his measure; it has a false bottom--\\r\\nit holds only three-quarters as much as it ought to do; and his numerous\\r\\ncustomers have all been cheated of one-quarter of every measure of the\\r\\nadmirable sugar-plums they have bought from him.  \\'Think twice of a good\\r\\nbargain,\\' says the proverb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So we have been finely duped, indeed,\" cried some of the bystanders,\\r\\nlooking at one another with a mortified air.  \"Full of courtesy, full of\\r\\ncraft!\" *  \"So this is the meaning of his burnt almonds gratis,\" cried\\r\\nothers; all joined in an uproar of indignation, except one, who, as he\\r\\nstood behind the rest, expressed in his countenance silent surprise and\\r\\nsorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Chi et FA pi caress che non vole,\\r\\nO ingannato t\\'ha, o inganuar et vole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this Piedro a relation of yours?\" said Carlo, going up to this silent\\r\\nperson.  \"I am sorry, if he be, that I have published his disgrace, for I\\r\\nwould not hurt YOU.  You don\\'t sell sugar-plums as he does, I\\'m sure; for\\r\\nmy little sister Rosetta has often bought from you.  Can this Piedro be a\\r\\nfriend of yours?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wished to have been his friend; but I see I can\\'t,\" said Francisco.\\r\\n\"He is a neighbour of ours, and I pitied him; but since he is at his old\\r\\ntricks again, there\\'s an end of the matter.  I have reason to be obliged\\r\\nto you, for I was nearly taken in.  He has behaved so well for some time\\r\\npast, that I intended this very evening to have gone to him, and to have\\r\\ntold him that I was willing to do for him what he has long begged of me\\r\\nto do--to enter into partnership with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Francisco! Francisco!--your measure, lend us your measure!\" exclaimed a\\r\\nnumber of little merchants crowding round him.  \"You have a measure for\\r\\nsugar-plums; and we have all agreed to refer to that, and to see how much\\r\\nwe have been cheated before we go to break Piedro\\'s bench and declare him\\r\\nbankrupt, *--the punishment for all knaves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n* This word comes from two Italian words, bunco rotto--broken bench.\\r\\nBankers and merchants used formerly to count their money, and write their\\r\\nbills of exchange upon benches in the streets; and when a merchant or\\r\\nbanker lost his credit, and was unable to pay his debts, his bench was\\r\\nbroken.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey pressed on to Francisco\\'s board, obtained his measure, found that it\\r\\nheld something more than a quarter above the quantity that could be\\r\\ncontained in Piedro\\'s.  The cries of the enraged populace were now most\\r\\nclamorous.  They hung the just and the unjust measures upon high poles;\\r\\nand, forming themselves into a formidable phalanx, they proceeded towards\\r\\nPiedro\\'s well known yellow lettered board, exclaiming, as they went\\r\\nalong, \"Common cause! common cause!  The little Neapolitan merchants will\\r\\nhave no knaves amongst them!  Break his bench! break his bench!  He is a\\r\\nbankrupt in honesty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro saw the mob, heard the indignant clamour, and, terrified at the\\r\\napproach of numbers, he fled with the utmost precipitation, having\\r\\nscarcely time to pack up half his sugar-plums.  There was a prodigious\\r\\nnumber, more than would have filled many honest measures, scattered upon\\r\\nthe ground and trampled under foot by the crowd.  Piedro\\'s bench was\\r\\nbroken, and the public vengeance wreaked itself also upon his treacherous\\r\\npainted board.  It was, after being much disfigured by various\\r\\ninscriptions expressive of the universal contempt for Piedro, hung up in\\r\\na conspicuous part of the market-place; and the false measure was\\r\\nfastened like a cap upon one of its corners.  Piedro could never more\\r\\nshow his face in this market, and all hopes of friendship--all hopes of\\r\\npartnership with Francisco--were for ever at an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf rogues would calculate, they would cease to be rogues; for they would\\r\\ncertainly discover that it is most for their interest to be honest--\\r\\nsetting aside the pleasure of being esteemed and beloved, of having a\\r\\nsafe conscience, with perfect freedom from all the various embarrassments\\r\\nand terror to which knaves are subject.  Is it not clear that our crafty\\r\\nhero would have gained rather more by a partnership with Francisco, and\\r\\nby a fair character, than he could possibly obtain by fraudulent dealing\\r\\nin comfits?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the mob had dispersed, after satisfying themselves with executing\\r\\nsummary justice upon Piedro\\'s bench and board, Francisco found a\\r\\ncarpenter\\'s rule lying upon the ground near Piedro\\'s broken bench, which\\r\\nhe recollected to have seen in the hands of Carlo.  He examined it\\r\\ncarefully, and he found Carlo\\'s name written upon it, and the name of the\\r\\nstreet where he lived; and though it was considerably out of his way, he\\r\\nset out immediately to restore the rule, which was a very handsome one,\\r\\nto its rightful owner.  After a hot walk through several streets, he\\r\\novertook Carlo, who had just reached the door of his own house.  Carlo\\r\\nwas particularly obliged to him, he said, for restoring this rule to him,\\r\\nas it was a present from the master of a vessel, who employed his father\\r\\nto do carpenter\\'s work for him.  \"One should not praise one\\'s self, they\\r\\nsay,\" continued Carlo, \"but I long so much to gain your good opinion,\\r\\nthat I must tell you the whole history of the rule you have restored.  It\\r\\nwas given to me for having measured the work and made up the bill of a\\r\\nwhole pleasure-boat myself.  You may guess I should have been sorry\\r\\nenough to have lost it.  Thank you for its being once more in my careless\\r\\nhands, and tell me, I beg, whenever I can do you any service.  By-the-by,\\r\\nI can make up for you a fruit stall.  I\\'ll do it to-morrow, and it shall\\r\\nbe the admiration of the market.  Is there anything else you could think\\r\\nof for me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, yes,\" said Francisco; \"since you are so good-natured, perhaps you\\'d\\r\\nbe kind enough to tell me the meaning of some of those lines and figures\\r\\nthat I see upon your rule.  I have a great curiosity to know their use.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That I\\'ll explain to you with pleasure, as far as I know them myself;\\r\\nbut when I\\'m at fault, my father, who is cleverer than I am, and\\r\\nunderstands trigonometry, can help us out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Trigonometry!\" repeated Francisco, not a little alarmed at the high\\r\\nsounding word; \"that\\'s what I certainly shall never understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, never fear,\" replied Carlo, laughing.  \"I looked just as you do now-\\r\\n-I felt just as you do now--all in a fright and a puzzle, when I first\\r\\nheard of angles and sines, and cosines, and arcs and centres, and\\r\\ncomplements and tangents.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh mercy! mercy!\" interrupted Francisco, whilst Carlo laughed, with a\\r\\nbenevolent sense of superiority.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" said Carlo, \"you\\'ll find all these things are nothing when you are\\r\\nused to them.  But I cannot explain my rule to you here broiling in the\\r\\nsun.  Besides, it will not be the work of a day, I promise you; but come\\r\\nand see us at your leisure hours, and we\\'ll study it together.  I have a\\r\\ngreat notion we shall become friends; and, to begin, step in with me\\r\\nnow,\" said Carlo, \"and eat a little macaroni with us.  I know it is ready\\r\\nby this time.  Besides, you\\'ll see my father, and he\\'ll show you plenty\\r\\nof rules and compasses, as you like such things; and then I\\'ll go home\\r\\nwith you in the cool of the evening, and you shall show me your melons\\r\\nand vines, and teach me, in time, something of gardening.  Oh, I see we\\r\\nmust be good friends, just made for each other; so come in--no ceremony.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCarlo was not mistaken in his predictions; he and Francisco became very\\r\\ngood friends, spent all their leisure hours together, either in Carlo\\'s\\r\\nworkshop or in Francisco\\'s vineyard, and they mutually improved each\\r\\nother.  Francisco, before he saw his friend\\'s rule, knew but just enough\\r\\nof arithmetic to calculate in his head the price of the fruit which he\\r\\nsold in the market; but with Carlo\\'s assistance, and the ambition to\\r\\nunderstand the tables and figures upon the wonderful rule, he set to work\\r\\nin earnest, and in due time, satisfied both himself and his master.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who knows but these things that I am learning now may be of some use to\\r\\nme before I die?\" said Francisco, as he was sitting one morning with his\\r\\ntutor, the carpenter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure it will,\" said the carpenter, putting down his compasses,\\r\\nwith which he was drawing a circle--\"Arithmetic is a most useful, and I\\r\\nwas going to say necessary thing to be known by men in all stations; and\\r\\na little trigonometry does no harm.  In short, my maxim is, that no\\r\\nknowledge comes amiss; for a man\\'s head is of as much use to him as his\\r\\nhands; and even more so.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"A word to the wise will always suffice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Besides, to say nothing of making a fortune, is not there a great\\r\\npleasure in being something of a scholar, and being able to pass one\\'s\\r\\ntime with one\\'s book, and one\\'s compasses and pencil?  Safe companions\\r\\nthese for young and old.  No one gets into mischief that has pleasant\\r\\nthings to think of and to do when alone; and I know, for my part, that\\r\\ntrigonometry is--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the carpenter, just as he was going to pronounce a fresh panegyric\\r\\nupon his favourite trigonometry, was interrupted by the sudden entrance\\r\\nof his little daughter Rosetta, all in tears:  a very unusual spectacle,\\r\\nfor, taking the year round, she shed fewer tears than any child of her\\r\\nage in Naples.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, my dear good humoured little Rosetta, what has happened?  Why these\\r\\nlarge tears?\" said her brother Carlo, and he went up to her, and wiped\\r\\nthem from her cheeks.  \"And these that are going over the bridge of the\\r\\nnose so fast?  I must stop these tears, too,\" said Carlo.\\r\\n\\r\\nRosetta, at this speech, burst out laughing, and said that she did not\\r\\nknow till then that she had any bridge on her nose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And were these shells the cause of the tears?\" said her brother, looking\\r\\nat a heap of shells, which she held before her in her frock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, partly,\" said Rosetta.  \"It was partly my own fault, but not all.\\r\\nYou know I went out to the carpenter\\'s yard, near the arsenal, where all\\r\\nthe children are picking up chips and sticks so busily; and I was as busy\\r\\nas any of them, because I wanted to fill my basket soon; and then I\\r\\nthought I should sell my basketful directly in the little wood-market.\\r\\nAs soon as I had filled my basket, and made up my faggot (which was not\\r\\ndone, brother, till I was almost baked by the sun, for I was forced to\\r\\nwait by the carpenters for the bits of wood to make up my faggot)--I say,\\r\\nwhen it was all ready, and my basket full, I left it altogether in the\\r\\nyard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That was not wise to leave it,\" said Carlo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I only left it for a few minutes, brother, and I could not think\\r\\nanybody would be so dishonest as to take it whilst I was away.  I only\\r\\njust ran to tell a boy, who had picked up all these beautiful shells upon\\r\\nthe sea-shore, and who wanted to sell them, that I should be glad to buy\\r\\nthem from him, if he would only be so good as to keep them for me, for an\\r\\nhour or so, till I had carried my wood to market, and till I had sold it,\\r\\nand so had money to pay him for the shells.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your heart was set mightily on these shells, Rosetta.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; for I thought you and Francisco, brother, would like to have them\\r\\nfor your nice grotto that you are making at Resina.  That was the reason\\r\\nI was in such a hurry to get them.  The boy who had them to sell was very\\r\\ngood-natured; he poured them into my lap, and said I had such an honest\\r\\nface he would trust me, and that as he was in a great hurry, he could not\\r\\nwait an hour whilst I sold my wood; but that he was sure I would pay him\\r\\nin the evening, and he told me that he would call here this evening for\\r\\nthe money.  But now what shall I do, Carlo?  I shall have no money to\\r\\ngive him:  I must give back his shells, and that\\'s a great pity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how happened it that you did not sell your wood?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I forgot; did not I tell you that?  When I went for my basket, do\\r\\nyou know it was empty, quite empty, not a chip left?  Some dishonest\\r\\nperson had carried it all off.  Had not I reason to cry now, Carlo?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll go this minute into the wood-market, and see if I can find your\\r\\nfaggot.  Won\\'t that be better than crying?\" said her brother.  \"Should\\r\\nyou know any one of your pieces of wood again if you were to see them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, one of them, I am sure, I should know again,\" said Rosetta.  \"It\\r\\nhad a notch at one end of it, where one of the carpenters cut it off from\\r\\nanother piece of wood for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is this piece of wood from which the carpenter cut it still to be\\r\\nseen?\" said Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, it is in the yard; but I cannot bring it to you, for it is very\\r\\nheavy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We can go to it,\" said Francisco, \"and I hope we shall recover your\\r\\nbasketful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCarlo and his friend went with Rosetta immediately to the yard, near the\\r\\narsenal, saw the notched piece of wood, and then proceeded to the little\\r\\nwood-market, and searched every heap that lay before the little factors;\\r\\nbut no notched bit was to be found, and Rosetta declared that she did not\\r\\nsee one stick that looked at all like any of hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn their part, her companions eagerly untied their faggots to show them\\r\\nto her, and exclaimed, \"That they were incapable of taking what did not\\r\\nbelong to them; that of all persons they should never have thought of\\r\\ntaking anything from the good natured little Rosetta, who was always\\r\\nready to give to others, and to help them in making up their loads.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDespairing of discovering the thief, Francisco and Carlo left the market.\\r\\nAs they were returning home, they were met by the English servant Arthur,\\r\\nwho asked Francisco where he had been, and where he was going.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as he heard of Rosetta\\'s lost faggot, and of the bit of wood,\\r\\nnotched at one end, of which Rosetta drew the shape with a piece of\\r\\nchalk, which her brother had lent her, Arthur exclaimed, \"I have seen\\r\\nsuch a bit of wood as this within this quarter of an hour; but I cannot\\r\\nrecollect where.  Stay! this was at the baker\\'s, I think, where I went\\r\\nfor some rolls for my master.  It was lying beside his oven.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the baker\\'s they all went as fast as possible, and they got there but\\r\\njust in time.  The baker had in his hand the bit of wood with which he\\r\\nwas that instant going to feed his oven.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop, good Mr. Baker!\" cried Rosetta, who ran into the baker\\'s shop\\r\\nfirst; and as he heard \"Stop! stop!\" re-echoed by many voices, the baker\\r\\nstopped; and turning to Francisco, Carlo and Arthur, begged, with a\\r\\ncountenance of some surprise, to know why they had desired him to stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe case was easily explained, and the baker told them that he did not\\r\\nbuy any wood in the little market that morning; that this faggot he had\\r\\npurchased between the hours of twelve and one from a lad about\\r\\nFrancisco\\'s height, whom he met near the yard of the arsenal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is my bit of wood, I am sure; I know it by this notch,\" said\\r\\nRosetta.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said the baker, \"if you will stay here a few minutes, you will\\r\\nprobably see the lad who sold it to me.  He desired to be paid in bread,\\r\\nand my bread was not quite baked when he was here.  I bid him call again\\r\\nin an hour, and I fancy he will be pretty punctual, for he looked\\r\\ndesperately hungry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe baker had scarcely finished speaking when Francisco, who was standing\\r\\nwatching at the door, exclaimed, \"Here comes Piedro!  I hope he is not\\r\\nthe boy who sold you the wood, Mr. Baker?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is the boy, though,\" replied the baker, and Piedro, who now entered\\r\\nthe shop, started at the sight of Carlo and Francisco, whom he had never\\r\\nseen since the day of disgrace in the fruit-market.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your servant, Signor Piedro,\" said Carlo; \"I have the honour to tell you\\r\\nthat this piece of wood, and all that you took out of the basket, which\\r\\nyou found in the yard of the arsenal, belongs to my sister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Rosetta.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro being very certain that nobody saw him when he emptied Rosetta\\'s\\r\\nbasket, and imagining that he was suspected only upon the bare assertion\\r\\nof a child like Rosetta, who might be baffled and frightened out of her\\r\\nstory, boldly denied the charge, and defied any one to prove him guilty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has a right to be heard in his own defence,\" said Arthur, with the\\r\\ncool justice of an Englishman; and he stopped the angry Carlo\\'s arm, who\\r\\nwas going up to the culprit with all the Italian vehemence of oratory and\\r\\ngesture.  Arthur went on to say something in bad Italian about the\\r\\nexcellence of an English trial by jury, which Carlo was too much enraged\\r\\nto hear, but to which Francisco paid attention, and turning to Piedro, he\\r\\nasked him if he was willing to be judged by twelve of his equals?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With all my heart,\" said Piedro, still maintaining an unmoved\\r\\ncountenance, and they returned immediately to the little wood-market.  On\\r\\ntheir way, they had passed through the fruit-market, and crowds of those\\r\\nwho were well acquainted with Piedro\\'s former transactions followed, to\\r\\nhear the event of the present trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur could not, especially as he spoke wretched Italian, make the eager\\r\\nlittle merchants understand the nature and advantages of an English trial\\r\\nby jury.  They preferred their own summary mode of proceeding.\\r\\nFrancisco, in whose integrity they all had perfect confidence, was chosen\\r\\nwith unanimous shouts for the judge; but he declined the office, and\\r\\nanother was appointed.  He was raised upon a bench, and the guilty but\\r\\ninsolent looking Piedro, and the ingenuous, modest Rosetta stood before\\r\\nhim.  She made her complaint in a very artless manner; and Piedro, with\\r\\ningenuity, which in a better cause would have deserved admiration, spoke\\r\\nvolubly and craftily in his own defence.  But all that he could say could\\r\\nnot alter facts.  The judge compared the notched bit of wood found at the\\r\\nbaker\\'s with a piece from which it was cut, which he went to see in the\\r\\nyard of the arsenal.  It was found to fit exactly.  The judge then found\\r\\nit impossible to restrain the loud indignation of all the spectators.\\r\\nThe prisoner was sentenced never more to sell wood in the market; and the\\r\\nmoment sentence was pronounced, Piedro was hissed and hooted out of the\\r\\nmarket-place.  Thus a third time he deprived himself of the means of\\r\\nearning his bread.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall not dwell upon all his petty methods of cheating in the trades\\r\\nhe next attempted.  He handed lemonade about in a part of Naples where he\\r\\nwas not known, but he lost his customers by putting too much water and\\r\\ntoo little lemon into this beverage.  He then took to the waters from the\\r\\nsulphurous springs, and served them about to foreigners; but one day, as\\r\\nhe was trying to jostle a competitor from the coach door, he slipped his\\r\\nfoot, and broke his glasses.  They had been borrowed from an old woman,\\r\\nwho hired out glasses to the boys who sold lemonade.  Piedro knew that it\\r\\nwas the custom to pay, of course, for all that was broken; but this he\\r\\nwas not inclined to do.  He had a few shillings in his pocket, and\\r\\nthought that it would be very clever to defraud this poor woman of her\\r\\nright, and to spend his shillings upon what he valued much more than he\\r\\ndid his good name--macaroni.  The shillings were soon gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall now for the present leave Piedro to his follies and his fate;\\r\\nor, to speak more properly, to his follies and their inevitable\\r\\nconsequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco was all this time acquiring knowledge from his new friends,\\r\\nwithout neglecting his own or his father\\'s business.  He contrived,\\r\\nduring the course of autumn and winter, to make himself a tolerable\\r\\narithmetician.  Carlo\\'s father could draw plans in architecture neatly;\\r\\nand pleased with the eagerness Francisco showed to receive instruction,\\r\\nhe willingly put a pencil and compasses into his hand, and taught him all\\r\\nhe knew himself.  Francisco had great perseverance, and, by repeated\\r\\ntrials, he at length succeeded in copying exactly all the plans which his\\r\\nmaster lent him.  His copies, in time, surpassed the originals, and Carlo\\r\\nexclaimed, with astonishment:  \"Why, Francisco, what an astonishing\\r\\nGENIUS you have for drawing!--Absolutely you draw plans better than my\\r\\nfather!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As to genius,\" said Francisco, honestly, \"I have none.  All that I have\\r\\ndone has been done by hard labour.  I don\\'t know how other people do\\r\\nthings; but I am sure that I never have been able to get anything done\\r\\nwell but by patience.  Don\\'t you remember, Carlo, how you and even\\r\\nRosetta laughed at me the first time your father put a pencil into my\\r\\nawkward, clumsy hands?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because,\" said Carlo, laughing again at the recollection, \"you held your\\r\\npencil so drolly; and when you were to cut it, you cut it just as if you\\r\\nwere using a pruning-knife to your vines; but now it is your turn to\\r\\nlaugh, for you surpass us all.  And the times are changed since I set\\r\\nabout to explain this rule of mine to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, that rule,\" said Francisco--\"how much I owe to it!  Some great\\r\\npeople, when they lose any of their fine things, cause the crier to\\r\\npromise a reward of so much money to anyone who shall find and restore\\r\\ntheir trinket.  How richly have you and your father rewarded me for\\r\\nreturning this rule!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco\\'s modesty and gratitude, as they were perfectly sincere,\\r\\nattached his friends to him most powerfully; but there was one person who\\r\\nregretted our hero\\'s frequent absences from his vineyard at Resina.  Not\\r\\nFrancisco\\'s father, for he was well satisfied his son never neglected his\\r\\nbusiness; and as to the hours spent in Naples, he had so much confidence\\r\\nin Francisco that he felt no apprehensions of his getting into bad\\r\\ncompany.  When his son had once said to him, \"I spend my time at such a\\r\\nplace, and in such and such a manner,\" he was as well convinced of its\\r\\nbeing so as if he had watched and seen him every moment of the day.  But\\r\\nit was Arthur who complained of Francisco\\'s absence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see, because I am an Englishman,\" said he, \"you don\\'t value my\\r\\nfriendship, and yet that is the very reason you ought to value it; no\\r\\nfriends so good as the English, be it spoken without offence to your\\r\\nItalian friend, for whom you now continually leave me to dodge up and\\r\\ndown here in Resina, without a soul that I like to speak to, for you are\\r\\nthe only Italian I ever liked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall like another, I promise you,\" said Francisco.  \"You must come\\r\\nwith me to Carlo\\'s, and see how I spend my evenings; then complain of me,\\r\\nif you can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the utmost stretch of Arthur\\'s complaisance to pay this visit;\\r\\nbut, in spite of his national prejudices and habitual reserve of temper,\\r\\nhe was pleased with the reception he met with from the generous Carlo and\\r\\nthe playful Rosetta.  They showed him Francisco\\'s drawings with\\r\\nenthusiastic eagerness; and Arthur, though no great judge of drawing, was\\r\\nin astonishment, and frequently repeated, \"I know a gentleman who visits\\r\\nmy master who would like these things.  I wish I might have them to show\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take them, then,\" said Carlo; \"I wish all Naples could see them,\\r\\nprovided they might be liked half as well as I like them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur carried off the drawings, and one day, when his master was better\\r\\nthan usual, and when he was at leisure, eating a dessert of Francisco\\'s\\r\\ngrapes, he entered respectfully, with his little portfolio under his arm,\\r\\nand begged permission to show his master a few drawings done by the\\r\\ngardener\\'s son, whose grapes he was eating.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough not quite so partial a judge as the enthusiastic Carlo, this\\r\\ngentleman was both pleased and surprised at the sight of these drawings,\\r\\nconsidering how short a time Francisco had applied himself to this art,\\r\\nand what slight instructions he had received.  Arthur was desired to\\r\\nsummon the young artist.  Francisco\\'s honest, open manner, joined to the\\r\\nproofs he had given of his abilities, and the character Arthur gave him\\r\\nfor strict honesty, and constant kindness to his parents, interested Mr.\\r\\nLee, the name of this English gentleman, much in his favour.  Mr. Lee was\\r\\nat this time in treaty with an Italian painter, whom he wished to engage\\r\\nto copy for him exactly some of the cornices, mouldings, tablets, and\\r\\nantique ornaments which are to be seen amongst the ruins of the ancient\\r\\ncity of Herculaneum. *\\r\\n\\r\\n* We must give those of our young English readers who may not be\\r\\nacquainted with the ancient city of Herculaneum, some idea of it.  None\\r\\ncan be ignorant that near Naples is the celebrated volcanic mountain of\\r\\nVesuvius;--that, from time to time, there happen violent eruptions from\\r\\nthis mountain; that is to say, flames and immense clouds of smoke issue\\r\\nfrom different openings, mouths, or CRATERS, as they are called, but more\\r\\nespecially from the summit of the mountain, which is distinguished by the\\r\\nname of THE crater.  A rumbling, and afterwards a roaring noise is heard\\r\\nwithin, and prodigious quantities of stones and minerals burnt into\\r\\nmasses (scoriae), are thrown out of the crater, sometimes to a great\\r\\ndistance.  The hot ashes from Mount Vesuvius have often been seen upon\\r\\nthe roofs of the houses of Naples, from which it is six miles distant.\\r\\nStreams of lava run down the sides of the mountains during the time of an\\r\\neruption, destroying everything in their way, and overwhelm the houses\\r\\nand vineyards which are in the neighbourhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 17OO years ago, during the reign of the Roman Emperor Titus, there\\r\\nhappened a terrible eruption of Mount Vesuvius; and a large city called\\r\\nHerculaneum, which was situated at about four miles\\' distance from the\\r\\nvolcano, was overwhelmed by the streams of lava which poured into it,\\r\\nfilled up the streets, and quickly covered over the tops of the houses,\\r\\nso that the whole was no more visible.  It remained for many years\\r\\nburied.  The lava which covered it became in time fit for vegetation,\\r\\nplants grew there, a new soil was formed, and a new town called Portici\\r\\nwas built over this place where Herculaneum formerly stood.  The little\\r\\nvillage of Resina is also situated near the spot.  About fifty years ago,\\r\\nin a poor man\\'s garden at Resina, a hole in a well about thirty feet\\r\\nbelow the surface of the earth was observed.  Some persons had the\\r\\ncuriosity to enter into this hole, and, after creeping underground for\\r\\nsome time, they came to the foundations of houses.  The peasants,\\r\\ninhabitants of the village, who had probably never heard of Herculaneum,\\r\\nwere somewhat surprised at their discovery.**  About the same time, in a\\r\\npit in the town of Portici, a similar passage underground was discovered,\\r\\nand, by orders of the King of Naples, workmen were employed to dig away\\r\\nthe earth, and clear the passage.  They found, at length, the entrance\\r\\ninto the town, which, during the reign of Titus, was buried under lava.\\r\\nIt was about eighty-eight Neapolitan palms (a palm contains near nine\\r\\ninches) below the top of the pit.  The workmen, as they cleared the\\r\\npassages, marked their way with chalk when they came to any turning, lest\\r\\nthey should lose themselves.  The streets branched out in many\\r\\ndirections, and, lying across them, the workmen often found large pieces\\r\\nof timber, beams, and rafters; some broken in the fall, others entire.\\r\\nThese beams and rafters are burned quite black like charcoal, except\\r\\nthose that were found in moist places, which have more the colour of\\r\\nrotten wood, and which are like a soft paste, into which you might run\\r\\nyour hand.  The walls of the houses slant, some one way, some another,\\r\\nand some are upright.  Several magnificent buildings of brick, faced with\\r\\nmarble of different colours, are partly seen, where the workmen have\\r\\ncleared away the earth and lava with which they were encrusted.  Columns\\r\\nof red and white marble, and flights of steps, are seen in different\\r\\nplaces; and out of the ruins of the palaces some very fine statues and\\r\\npictures have been dug.  Foreigners who visit Naples are very curious to\\r\\nsee this subterraneous city, and are desirous to carry with them into\\r\\ntheir own country some proofs of their having examined this wonderful\\r\\nplace.\\r\\n\\r\\n** Philosophical Transactions, vol. ix. p. 440.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Tutte le gran faciende si fanno di poca cosa.\\r\\n     What great events from trivial causes spring.\\r\\n\\r\\nSignor Camillo, the artist employed by Mr. Lee to copy some of the\\r\\nantique ornaments in Herculaneum, was a liberal minded man, perfectly\\r\\nfree from that mean jealousy which would repress the efforts of rising\\r\\ngenius.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is a lad scarcely fifteen, a poor gardener\\'s son, who, with merely\\r\\nthe instructions he could obtain from a common carpenter, has learned to\\r\\ndraw these plans and elevations, which you see are tolerably neat.  What\\r\\nan advantage your instruction would be to him,\" said Mr. Lee, as he\\r\\nintroduced Francisco to Signor Camillo.  \"I am interested in this lad\\r\\nfrom what I have learned of his good conduct.  I hear he is strictly\\r\\nhonest, and one of the best of sons.  Let us do something for him.  If\\r\\nyou will give him some knowledge of your art, I will, as far as money can\\r\\nrecompense you for your loss of time, pay whatever you may think\\r\\nreasonable for his instruction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSignor Camillo made no difficulties; he was pleased with his pupil\\'s\\r\\nappearance, and every day he liked him better and better.  In the room\\r\\nwhere they worked together there were some large books of drawings and\\r\\nplates, which Francisco saw now and then opened by his master, and which\\r\\nhe had a great desire to look over; but when he was left in the room by\\r\\nhimself he never touched them, because he had not permission.  Signor\\r\\nCamillo, the first day he came into this room with his pupil, said to\\r\\nhim, \"Here are many valuable books and drawings, young man.  I trust,\\r\\nfrom the character I have heard of you, that they will be perfectly safe\\r\\nhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSome weeks after Francisco had been with the painter, they had occasion\\r\\nto look for the front of a temple in one of these large books.  \"What!\\r\\ndon\\'t you know in which book to look for it, Francisco?\" cried his\\r\\nmaster, with some impatience.  \"Is it possible that you have been here so\\r\\nlong with these books, and that you cannot find the print I mean?  Had\\r\\nyou half the taste I gave you credit for, you would have singled it out\\r\\nfrom all the rest, and have it fixed in your memory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, signor, I never saw it,\" said Francisco, respectfully, \"or,\\r\\nperhaps, I should have preferred it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That you never saw it, young man, is the very thing of which I complain.\\r\\nIs a taste for the arts to be learned, think you, by looking at the cover\\r\\nof a book like this?  Is it possible that you never thought of opening\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Often and often,\" cried Francisco, \"have I longed to open it; but I\\r\\nthought it was forbidden me, and however great my curiosity in your\\r\\nabsence, I have never touched them.  I hoped indeed, that the time would\\r\\ncome when you would have the goodness to show them to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so the time is come, excellent young man,\" cried Camillo; \"much as I\\r\\nlove taste, I love integrity more.  I am now sure of your having the one,\\r\\nand let me see whether you have, as I believe you have, the other.  Sit\\r\\nyou down here beside me; and we will look over these books together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attention with which his young pupil examined everything, and the\\r\\npleasure he unaffectedly expressed in seeing these excellent prints,\\r\\nsufficiently convinced his judicious master that it was not from the want\\r\\nof curiosity or taste that he had never opened these tempting volumes.\\r\\nHis confidence in Francisco was much increased by this circumstance,\\r\\nslight as it may appear.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, Signor Camillo came behind Francisco, as he was drawing with\\r\\nmuch intentness, and tapping him upon the shoulder, he said to him:  \"Put\\r\\nup your pencils and follow me, I can depend upon your integrity; I have\\r\\npledged myself for it.  Bring your note-book with you, and follow me; I\\r\\nwill this day show you something that will entertain you at least as much\\r\\nas my large book of prints.  Follow me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco followed, till they came to the pit near the entrance of\\r\\nHerculaneum.  \"I have obtained leave for you to accompany me,\" said his\\r\\nmaster, \"and you know, I suppose, that this is not a permission granted\\r\\nto everyone?\"  Paintings of great value, besides ornaments of gold and\\r\\nsilver, antique bracelets, rings, etc., are from time to time found\\r\\namongst these ruins, and therefore it is necessary that no person should\\r\\nbe admitted whose honesty cannot be depended upon.  Thus, even\\r\\nFrancisco\\'s talents could not have advanced him in the world, unless they\\r\\nhad been united to integrity.  He was much delighted and astonished by\\r\\nthe new scene that was now opened to his view; and as, day after day, he\\r\\naccompanied his master to this subterraneous city, he had leisure for\\r\\nobservation.  He was employed, as soon as he had gratified his curiosity,\\r\\nin drawing.  There are niches in the walls in several places, from which\\r\\npictures have been dug, and these niches are often adorned with elegant\\r\\nmasques, figures and animals, which have been left by the ignorant or\\r\\ncareless workmen, and which are going fast to destruction.  Signor\\r\\nCamillo, who was copying these for his English employer, had a mind to\\r\\ntry his pupil\\'s skill, and, pointing to a niche bordered with grotesque\\r\\nfigures, he desired him to try if he could make any hand of it.\\r\\nFrancisco made several trials, and at last finished such an excellent\\r\\ncopy, that his enthusiastic and generous master, with warm encomiums,\\r\\ncarried it immediately to his patron, and he had the pleasure to receive\\r\\nfrom Mr. Lee a purse containing five guineas, as a reward and\\r\\nencouragement for his pupil.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco had no sooner received this money, than he hurried to his\\r\\nfather and mother\\'s cottage.  His mother, some months before this time,\\r\\nhad taken a small dairy farm; and her son had once heard her express a\\r\\nwish that she was but rich enough to purchase a remarkably fine brindled\\r\\ncow, which belonged to a farmer in the neighbourhood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here, my dear mother,\" cried Francisco, pouring the guineas into her\\r\\nlap; \"and here,\" continued he, emptying a bag which contained about as\\r\\nmuch more, in small Italian coins, the profits of trade-money he had\\r\\nfairly earned during the two years he sold fruit amongst the little\\r\\nNeapolitan merchants; \"this is all yours, dearest mother, and I hope it\\r\\nwill be enough to pay for the brindled cow.  Nay, you must not refuse me-\\r\\n-I have set my heart upon the cow being milked by you this very evening;\\r\\nand I\\'ll produce my best bunches of grapes, and my father, perhaps, will\\r\\ngive us a melon; for I\\'ve had no time for melons this season; and I\\'ll\\r\\nstep to Naples and invite--may I, mother?--my good friends, dear Carlo\\r\\nand your favourite little Rosetta, and my old drawing master, and my\\r\\nfriend Arthur, and we\\'ll sup with you at your dairy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe happy mother thanked her son, and the father assured him that neither\\r\\nmelon nor pine-apple should be spared, to make a supper worthy of his\\r\\nfriends.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brindled cow was bought, and Arthur and Carlo and Rosetta most\\r\\njoyfully accepted their invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carpenter had unluckily appointed to settle a long account that day\\r\\nwith one of his employers, and he could not accompany his children.  It\\r\\nwas a delicious evening; they left Naples just as the sea-breeze, after\\r\\nthe heats of the day, was most refreshingly felt.  The walk to Resina,\\r\\nthe vineyard, the dairy, and most of all, the brindled cow, were praised\\r\\nby Carlo and Rosetta, with all the Italian superlatives which signify,\\r\\n\"Most beautiful! most delightful! most charming!\"  Whilst the English\\r\\nArthur, with as warm a heart, was more temperate in his praise, declaring\\r\\nthat this was \"the most like an English summer\\'s evening of any he had\\r\\never felt since he came to Italy:  and that, moreover, the cream was\\r\\nalmost as good as what he had been used to drink in Cheshire.\"  The\\r\\ncompany, who were all pleased with each other, and with the gardener\\'s\\r\\ngood fruit, which he produced in great abundance, did not think of\\r\\nseparating till late.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a bright moonlight night, and Carlo asked his friend if he would\\r\\nwalk with them part of the way to Naples.  \"Yes, all the way most\\r\\nwillingly,\" cried Francisco, \"that I may have the pleasure of giving to\\r\\nyour father, with my own hands, this fine bunch of grapes, that I have\\r\\nreserved for him out of my own share.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Add this fine pine-apple for my share, then,\" said his father, \"and a\\r\\npleasant walk to you, my young friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey proceeded gaily along, and when they reached Naples, as they passed\\r\\nthrough the square where the little merchants held their market,\\r\\nFrancisco pointed to the spot where he found Carlo\\'s rule.  He never\\r\\nmissed an opportunity of showing his friends that he did not forget their\\r\\nformer kindness to him.  \"That rule,\" said he, \"has been the cause of all\\r\\nmy present happiness, and I thank you for--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, never mind thanking him now,\" interrupted Rosetta, \"but look yonder,\\r\\nand tell me what all those people are about.\"  She pointed to a group of\\r\\nmen, women and children, who were assembled under a piazza, listening in\\r\\nvarious attitudes of attention to a man, who was standing upon a flight\\r\\nof steps speaking in a loud voice, and with much action, to the people\\r\\nwho surrounded him.  Francisco, Carlo and Rosetta joined his audience.\\r\\nThe moon shone full upon his countenance, which was very expressive and\\r\\nwhich varied frequently according to the characters of the persons whose\\r\\nhistory he was telling, according to all the changes of their fortune.\\r\\nThis man was one of those who are called Improvisatori--persons who, in\\r\\nItalian towns, go about reciting verses or telling stories, which they\\r\\nare supposed to invent as they go on speaking. Some of these people speak\\r\\nwith great fluency, and collect crowds round them in the public streets.\\r\\nWhen an Improvisatore sees the attention of his audience fixed, and when\\r\\nhe comes to some very interesting part of his narrative, he dexterously\\r\\ndrops his hat upon the ground, and pauses till his auditors have paid\\r\\ntribute to his eloquence.  When he thinks the hat sufficiently full, he\\r\\ntakes it up again, and proceeds with his story.  The hat was dropped just\\r\\nas Francisco and his two friends came under the piazza.  The orator had\\r\\nfinished one story, and was going to commence another.  He fixed his eyes\\r\\nupon Francisco, then glanced at Carlo and Rosetta, and after a moment\\'s\\r\\nconsideration he began a story which bore some resemblance to one that\\r\\nour young English readers may, perhaps, know by the name of \"Cornaro, or\\r\\nthe Grateful Turk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco was deeply interested in this narrative, and when the hat was\\r\\ndropped, he eagerly threw in his contribution.  At the end of the story,\\r\\nwhen the speaker\\'s voice stopped, there was a momentary silence, which\\r\\nwas broken by the orator himself, who exclaimed, as he took up the hat\\r\\nwhich lay at his feet, \"My friends, here is some mistake! this is not my\\r\\nhat; it has been changed whilst I was taken up with my story.  Pray,\\r\\ngentlemen, find my hat amongst you; it was a remarkably good one, a\\r\\npresent from a nobleman for an epigram I made.  I would not lose my hat\\r\\nfor twice its value.  It has my name written withinside of it, Dominicho,\\r\\nImprovisatore.  Pray, gentlemen, examine your hats.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody present examined their hats, and showed them to Dominicho, but\\r\\nhis was not amongst them.  No one had left the company; the piazza was\\r\\ncleared, and searched in vain.  \"The hat has vanished by magic,\" said\\r\\nDominicho.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and by the same magic a statue moves,\" cried Carlo, pointing to a\\r\\nfigure standing in a niche, which had hitherto escaped observation.  The\\r\\nface was so much in the shade, that Carlo did not at first perceive that\\r\\nthe statue was Piedro.  Piedro, when he saw himself discovered, burst\\r\\ninto a loud laugh, and throwing down Dominicho\\'s hat, which he held in\\r\\nhis hand behind him, cried, \"A pretty set of novices!  Most excellent\\r\\nplayers at hide-and-seek you would make.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether Piedro really meant to have carried off the poor man\\'s hat, or\\r\\nwhether he was, as he said, merely in jest, we leave it to those who know\\r\\nhis general character to decide.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarlo shook his head.  \"Still at your old tricks, Piedro,\" said he.\\r\\n\"Remember the old proverb:  No fox so cunning but he comes to the\\r\\nfurrier\\'s at last.\" *\\r\\n\\r\\n* Tutte le volpi si trovano in pellicera.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I defy the furrier and you, too,\" replied Piedro, taking up his own\\r\\nragged hat.  \"I have no need to steal hats; I can afford to buy better\\r\\nthan you\\'ll have upon your head.  Francisco, a word with you, if you have\\r\\ndone crying at the pitiful story you have been listening to so\\r\\nattentively.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what would you say to me?\" said Francisco, following him a few\\r\\nsteps.  \"Do not detain me long, because my friends will wait for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If they are friends, they can wait,\" said Piedro.  \"You need not be\\r\\nashamed of being seen in my company now, I can tell you; for I am, as I\\r\\nalways told you I should be, the richest man of the two.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rich! you rich?\" cried Francisco.  \"Well, then, it was impossible you\\r\\ncould mean to trick that poor man out of his good hat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impossible!\" said Piedro.  Francisco did not consider that those who\\r\\nhave habits of pilfering continue to practise them often, when the\\r\\npoverty which first tempted them to dishonesty ceases.  \"Impossible!  You\\r\\nstare when I tell you I am rich; but the thing is so.  Moreover, I am\\r\\nwell with my father at home.  I have friends in Naples, and I call myself\\r\\nPiedro the Lucky.  Look you here,\" said he, producing an old gold coin.\\r\\n\"This does not smell of fish, does it?  My father is no longer a\\r\\nfisherman, nor I either.  Neither do I sell sugar-plums to children:  nor\\r\\ndo I slave myself in a vineyard, like some folks; but fortune, when I\\r\\nleast expected it, has stood my friend.  I have many pieces of gold like\\r\\nthis.  Digging in my father\\'s garden, it was my luck to come to an old\\r\\nRoman vessel full of gold.  I have this day agreed for a house in Naples\\r\\nfor my father.  We shall live, whilst we can afford it, like great folks,\\r\\nyou will see; and I shall enjoy the envy that will be felt by some of my\\r\\nold friends, the little Neapolitan merchants, who will change their note\\r\\nwhen they see my change of fortune.  What say you to all this, Francisco\\r\\nthe Honest?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That I wish you joy of your prosperity, and hope you may enjoy it long\\r\\nand well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, no doubt of that.  Everyone who has it enjoys it WELL.  He always\\r\\ndances well to whom fortune pipes.\" *\\r\\n\\r\\n* Assai ben balla a chi fortuna suona.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, no longer pipe, no longer dance,\" replied Francisco; and here they\\r\\nparted; for Piedro walked away abruptly, much mortified to perceive that\\r\\nhis prosperity did not excite much envy, or command any additional\\r\\nrespect from Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would rather,\" said Francisco, when he returned to Carlo and Rosetta,\\r\\nwho waited for him under the portico, where he left them--\"I would rather\\r\\nhave such good friends as you, Carlo and Arthur, and some more I could\\r\\nname, and, besides that, have a clear conscience, and work honestly for\\r\\nmy bread, than be as lucky as Piedro.  Do you know he has found a\\r\\ntreasure, he says, in his father\\'s garden--a vase full of gold?  He\\r\\nshowed me one of the gold pieces.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Much good may they do him.  I hope he came honestly by them,\" said\\r\\nCarlo; \"but ever since the affair of the double measure, I suspect\\r\\ndouble-dealing always from him.  It is not our affair, however.  Let him\\r\\nmake himself happy his way, and we ours.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"He that would live in peace and rest,\\r\\n      Must hear, and see, and say the best.\" *\\r\\n\\r\\n* Odi, vedi, taci, se vuoi viver in pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Piedro\\'s neighbours did not follow this peaceable maxim; for when he\\r\\nand his father began to circulate the story of the treasure found in the\\r\\ngarden, the village of Resina did not give them implicit faith.  People\\r\\nnodded and whispered, and shrugged their shoulders; then crossed\\r\\nthemselves, and declared that they would not, for all the riches of\\r\\nNaples, change places with either Piedro or his father.  Regardless, or\\r\\npretending to be regardless, of these suspicions, Piedro and his father\\r\\npersisted in their assertions.  The fishing-nets were sold, and\\r\\neverything in their cottage was disposed of; they left Resina, went to\\r\\nlive at Naples, and, after a few weeks, the matter began to be almost\\r\\nforgotten in the village.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old gardener, Francisco\\'s father, was one of those who endeavoured to\\r\\nTHINK THE BEST; and all that he said upon the subject was, that he would\\r\\nnot exchange Francisco the Honest for Piedro the Lucky; that one can\\'t\\r\\njudge of the day till one sees the evening as well as the morning. *\\r\\n\\r\\n* La vita il fine,--e di loda la sera.\\r\\n\"Compute the morn and evening of their day.\"--Pope.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot to leave our readers longer in suspense, we must inform them that the\\r\\npeasants of Resina were right in their suspicions.  Piedro had never\\r\\nfound any treasure in his father\\'s garden, but he came by his gold in the\\r\\nfollowing manner:--\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter he was banished from the little wood-market for stealing Rosetta\\'s\\r\\nbasketful of wood, after he had cheated the poor woman, who let glasses\\r\\nout to hire, out of the value of the glasses which he broke, and, in\\r\\nshort, after he had entirely lost his credit with all who knew him, he\\r\\nroamed about the streets of Naples, reckless of what became of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found the truth of the proverb, \"that credit lost is like a Venice\\r\\nglass broken--it can\\'t be mended again.\"  The few shillings which he had\\r\\nin his pocket supplied him with food for a few days.  At last he was glad\\r\\nto be employed by one of the peasants who came to Naples to load their\\r\\nasses with manure out of the streets.  They often follow very early in\\r\\nthe morning, or during the night-time, the trace of carriages that are\\r\\ngone, or that are returning from the opera; and Piedro was one night at\\r\\nthis work, when the horses of a nobleman\\'s carriage took fright at the\\r\\nsudden blaze of some fireworks.  The carriage was overturned near him; a\\r\\nlady was taken out of it, and was hurried by her attendants into a shop,\\r\\nwhere she stayed till her carriage was set to rights.  She was too much\\r\\nalarmed for the first ten minutes after her accident to think of\\r\\nanything; but after some time, she perceived that she had lost a valuable\\r\\ndiamond cross, which she had worn that night at the opera.  She was\\r\\nuncertain where she had dropped it; the shop, the carriage, the street,\\r\\nwere searched for it in vain.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro saw it fall as the lady was lifted out of the carriage, seized\\r\\nupon it, and carried it off.  Ignorant as he was of the full value of\\r\\nwhat he had stolen, he knew not how to satisfy himself as to this point,\\r\\nwithout trusting someone with the secret.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some hesitation, he determined to apply to a Jew, who, as it was\\r\\nwhispered, was ready to buy everything that was offered to him for sale,\\r\\nwithout making any TROUBLESOME inquiries.  It was late; he waited till\\r\\nthe streets were cleared, and then knocked softly at the back door of the\\r\\nJew\\'s house.  The person who opened the door for Piedro was his own\\r\\nfather.  Piedro started back; but his father had fast hold of him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What brings you here?\" said the father, in a low voice, a voice which\\r\\nexpressed fear and rage mixed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only to ask my way--my shortest way,\" stammered Piedro.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No equivocations!  Tell me what brings you here at this time of the\\r\\nnight?  I WILL know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro, who felt himself in his father\\'s grasp, and who knew that his\\r\\nfather would certainly search him, to find out what he had brought to\\r\\nsell, thought it most prudent to produce the diamond cross.  His father\\r\\ncould but just see its lustre by the light of a dim lamp, which hung over\\r\\ntheir heads in the gloomy passage in which they stood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You would have been duped, if you had gone to sell this to the Jew.  It\\r\\nis well it has fallen into my hands.  How came you by it?\"  Piedro\\r\\nanswered that he had found it in the street.  \"Go your ways home, then,\"\\r\\nsaid his father; \"it is safe with me.  Concern yourself no more about\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro was not inclined thus to relinquish his booty, and he now thought\\r\\nproper to vary in his account of the manner in which he found the cross.\\r\\nHe now confessed that it had dropped from the dress of a lady, whose\\r\\ncarriage was overturned as she was coming home from the opera, and he\\r\\nconcluded by saying that, if his father took his prize from him without\\r\\ngiving him his share of the profits, he would go directly to the shop\\r\\nwhere the lady stopped whilst her servants were raising the carriage, and\\r\\nthat he would give notice of his having found the cross.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro\\'s father saw that his SMART son, though scarcely sixteen years of\\r\\nage, was a match for him in villainy.  He promised him that he should\\r\\nhave half of whatever the Jew would give for the diamonds, and Piedro\\r\\ninsisted upon being present at the transaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not wish to lay open to our young readers scenes of iniquity.  It\\r\\nis sufficient to say that the Jew, who was a man old in all the arts of\\r\\nvillainy, contrived to cheat both his associates, and obtained the\\r\\ndiamond cross for less than half its value.  The matter was managed so\\r\\nthat the transaction remained undiscovered.  The lady who lost the cross,\\r\\nafter making fruitless inquiries, gave up the search, and Piedro and his\\r\\nfather rejoiced in the success of their manoeuvres.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is said, that \"Ill gotten wealth is quickly spent\"; * and so it proved\\r\\nin this instance.  Both father and son lived a riotous life as long as\\r\\ntheir money lasted, and it did not last many months.  What his bad\\r\\neducation began, bad company finished, and Piedro\\'s mind was completely\\r\\nruined by the associates with whom he became connected during what he\\r\\ncalled his PROSPERITY.  When his money was at an end, these unprincipled\\r\\nfriends began to look cold upon him, and at last plainly told him--\"If\\r\\nyou mean to LIVE WITH US, you must LIVE AS WE DO.\"  They lived by\\r\\nrobbery.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Vien presto consumato l\\'ingiustamente acquistato.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro, though familiarized to the idea of fraud, was shocked at the\\r\\nthought of becoming a robber by profession.  How difficult it is to stop\\r\\nin the career of vice!  Whether Piedro had power to stop, or whether he\\r\\nwas hurried on by his associates, we shall, for the present, leave in\\r\\ndoubt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nWe turn with pleasure from Piedro the Cunning to Francisco the Honest.\\r\\nFrancisco continued the happy and useful course of his life.  By his\\r\\nunremitting perseverance, he improved himself rapidly under the\\r\\ninstructions of his master and friend, Signor Camillo; his friend, we\\r\\nsay, for the fair and open character of Francisco won, or rather earned,\\r\\nthe friendship of this benevolent artist.  The English gentleman seemed\\r\\nto take a pride in our hero\\'s success and good conduct.  He was not one\\r\\nof those patrons who think that they have done enough when they have\\r\\ngiven five guineas.  His servant Arthur always considered every generous\\r\\naction of his master\\'s as his own, and was particularly pleased whenever\\r\\nthis generosity was directed towards Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Carlo and the little Rosetta, they were the companions of all the\\r\\npleasant walks which Francisco used to take in the cool of the evening,\\r\\nafter he had been shut up all day at his work.  And the old carpenter,\\r\\ndelighted with the gratitude of his pupil, frequently repeated--\"that he\\r\\nwas proud to have given the first instructions to such a GENIUS; and that\\r\\nhe had always prophesied Francisco would be a GREAT man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And a good man, papa,\" said Rosetta; \"for though he has grown so great,\\r\\nand though he goes into palaces now, to say nothing of that place\\r\\nunderground, where he has leave to go, yet, notwithstanding all this, he\\r\\nnever forgets my brother Carlo and you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the way to have good friends,\" said the carpenter.  \"And I like\\r\\nhis way; he does more than he says.  Facts are masculine, and words are\\r\\nfeminine.\" *\\r\\n\\r\\n* I fatti sono maschii, le parole femmine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese goods friends seemed to make Francisco happier than Piedro could be\\r\\nmade by his stolen diamonds.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning, Francisco was sent to finish a sketch of the front of an\\r\\nancient temple, amongst the ruins of Herculaneum.  He had just reached\\r\\nthe pit, and the men were about to let him down with cords, in the usual\\r\\nmanner, when his attention was caught by the shrill sound of a scolding\\r\\nwoman\\'s voice.  He looked, and saw at some paces distant this female\\r\\nfury, who stood guarding the windlass of a well, to which, with\\r\\nthreatening gestures and most voluble menaces, she forbade all access.\\r\\nThe peasants--men, women and children, who had come with their pitchers\\r\\nto draw water at this well--were held at bay by the enraged female.  Not\\r\\none dared to be the first to advance; whilst she grasped with one hand\\r\\nthe handle of the windlass, and, with the other tanned muscular arm\\r\\nextended, governed the populace, bidding them remember that she was\\r\\npadrona, or mistress of the well.  They retired, in hopes of finding a\\r\\nmore gentle padrona at some other well in the neighbourhood; and the\\r\\nfury, when they were out of sight, divided the long black hair which hung\\r\\nover her face, and, turning to one of the spectators, appealed to them in\\r\\na sober voice, and asked if she was not right in what she had done?  \"I,\\r\\nthat am padrona of the well,\" said she, addressing herself to Francisco,\\r\\nwho, with great attention, was contemplating her with the eye of a\\r\\npainter--\"I, that am padrona of the well, must in times of scarcity do\\r\\nstrict justice, and preserve for ourselves alone the water of our well.\\r\\nThere is scarcely enough even for ourselves.  I have been obliged to make\\r\\nmy husband lengthen the ropes every day for this week past.  If things go\\r\\non at this rate, there will soon be not one drop of water left in my\\r\\nwell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor in any of the wells of the neighbourhood,\" added one of the workmen,\\r\\nwho was standing by; and he mentioned several in which the water had\\r\\nlately suddenly decreased; and a miller affirmed that his mill had\\r\\nstopped for want of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco was struck by these remarks.  They brought to his recollection\\r\\nsimilar facts, which he had often heard his father mention in his\\r\\nchildhood, as having been observed previous to the last eruption of Mount\\r\\nVesuvius. *  He had also heard from his father, in his childhood, that it\\r\\nis better to trust to prudence than to fortune; and therefore, though the\\r\\npeasants and workmen, to whom he mentioned his fears, laughed, and said,\\r\\n\"That as the burning mountain had been favourable to them for so many\\r\\nyears, they would trust to it and St.  Januarius one day longer,\" yet\\r\\nFrancisco immediately gave up all thoughts of spending this day amidst\\r\\nthe ruins of Herculaneum.  After having inquired sufficiently, after\\r\\nhaving seen several wells, in which the water had evidently decreased,\\r\\nand after having seen the mill-wheels that were standing still for want\\r\\nof their usual supply, he hastened home to his father and mother,\\r\\nreported what he had heard and seen, and begged of them to remove, and to\\r\\ntake what things of value they could to some distance from the dangerous\\r\\nspot where they now resided.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Phil. Trans. vol. ix.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the inhabitants of Resina, whom he questioned, declared that they\\r\\nhad heard strange rumbling noises underground; and a peasant and his son,\\r\\nwho had been at work the preceding day in a vineyard, a little above the\\r\\nvillage, related that they had seen a sudden puff of smoke come out of\\r\\nthe earth, close to them; and that they had, at the same time, heard a\\r\\nnoise like the going off of a pistol. *\\r\\n\\r\\n* These facts are mentioned in Sir William Hamilton\\'s account of an\\r\\neruption of Mount Vesuvius.--See Phil. Trans. 1795, first part.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe villagers listened with large eyes and open ears to these relations;\\r\\nyet such was their habitual attachment to the spot they lived upon, or\\r\\nsuch the security in their own good fortune, that few of them would\\r\\nbelieve that there could be any necessity for removing.--\"We\\'ll see what\\r\\nwill happen to-morrow; we shall be safe here one day longer,\" said they.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco\\'s father and mother, more prudent than the generality of their\\r\\nneighbours, went to the house of a relation, at some miles\\' distance from\\r\\nVesuvius, and carried with them all their effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, Francisco went to the villa where his English friends\\r\\nresided.  The villa was in a most dangerous situation, near Terre del\\r\\nGreco--a town that stands at the foot of Mount Vesuvius.  He related all\\r\\nthe facts that he had heard to Arthur, who, not having been, like the\\r\\ninhabitants of Resina, familiarized to the idea of living in the vicinity\\r\\nof a burning mountain, and habituated to trust in St. Januarius, was\\r\\nsufficiently alarmed by Francisco\\'s representations.  He ran to his\\r\\nmaster\\'s apartment, and communicated all that he had just heard.  The\\r\\nCount de Flora and his lady, who were at this time in the house,\\r\\nridiculed the fears of Arthur, and could not be prevailed upon to remove\\r\\neven as far as Naples.  The lady was intent upon preparations for her\\r\\nbirthday, which was to be celebrated in a few days with great\\r\\nmagnificence at their villa; and she observed that it would be a pity to\\r\\nreturn to town before that day, and they had everything arranged for the\\r\\nfestival.  The prudent Englishman had not the gallantry to appear to be\\r\\nconvinced by these arguments, and he left the place of danger.  He left\\r\\nit not too soon, for the next morning exhibited a scene--a scene which we\\r\\nshall not attempt to describe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe refer our young readers to the account of this dreadful eruption of\\r\\nMount Vesuvius, published by Sir W. Hamilton in the \"Philosophical\\r\\nTransactions.\"  It is sufficient here to say that, in the space of about\\r\\nfive hours, the wretched inhabitants of Torre del Greco saw their town\\r\\nutterly destroyed by the streams of burning lava which poured from the\\r\\nmountain.  The villa of Count de Flora, with some others, which were at a\\r\\nlittle distance from the town, escaped; but they were absolutely\\r\\nsurrounded by the lava.  The count and countess were obliged to fly from\\r\\ntheir house with the utmost precipitation in the night-time; and they had\\r\\nnot time to remove any of their furniture, their plate, clothes, or\\r\\njewels.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days after the eruption, the surface of the lava became so cool\\r\\nthat people could walk upon it, though several feet beneath the surface\\r\\nit was still exceedingly hot.  Numbers of those who had been forced from\\r\\ntheir houses now returned to the ruins to try to save whatever they\\r\\ncould.  But these unfortunate persons frequently found their houses had\\r\\nbeen pillaged by robbers, who, in these moments of general confusion,\\r\\nenrich themselves with the spoils of their fellow-creatures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has the count abandoned his villa? and is there no one to take care of\\r\\nhis plate and furniture?  The house will certainly be ransacked before\\r\\nmorning,\" said the old carpenter to Francisco, who was at his house\\r\\ngiving him an account of their flight.  Francisco immediately went to the\\r\\ncount\\'s house in warn him of his danger.  The first person he saw was\\r\\nArthur, who, with a face of terror, said to him, \"Do you know what has\\r\\nhappened?  It is all over with Resina!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All over with Resina!  What, has there been a fresh eruption?  Has the\\r\\nlava reached Resina?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; but it will inevitably be blown up.  There,\" said Arthur, pointing\\r\\nto a thin figure of an Italian, who stood pale and trembling, and looking\\r\\nup to heaven as he crossed himself repeatedly.  \"There,\" said Arthur, \"is\\r\\na man who has left a parcel of his cursed rockets and fireworks, with I\\r\\ndon\\'t know how much gunpowder, in the count\\'s house, from which we have\\r\\njust fled.  The wind blows that way.  One spark of fire, and the whole is\\r\\nblown up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco waited not to hear more; but instantly, without explaining his\\r\\nintentions to anyone, set out for the count\\'s villa, and, with a bucket\\r\\nof water in his hand, crossed the beds of lava with which the house was\\r\\nencompassed; when, reaching the hall where the rockets and gunpowder were\\r\\nleft, he plunged them into the water, and returned with them in safety\\r\\nover the lava, yet warm under his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was the surprise and joy of the poor firework-maker when he saw\\r\\nFrancisco return from this dangerous expedition!  He could scarcely\\r\\nbelieve his eyes, when he saw the rockets and the gunpowder all safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe count, who had given up the hopes of saving his palace, was in\\r\\nadmiration when he heard of this instance of intrepidity, which properly\\r\\nsaved not only his villa, but the whole village of Resina, from\\r\\ndestruction.  These fireworks had been prepared for the celebration of\\r\\nthe countess\\' birthday, and were forgotten in the hurry of the night on\\r\\nwhich the inhabitants fled from Torre del Greco.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Brave young man!\" said the count to Francisco, \"I thank you, and shall\\r\\nnot limit my gratitude to thanks.  You tell me that there is danger of my\\r\\nvilla being pillaged by robbers.  It is from this moment your interest,\\r\\nas well as mine, to prevent their depredations; for (trust to my\\r\\nliberality) a portion of all that is saved of mine shall be yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bravo! bravissimo!\" exclaimed one, who started from a recessed window in\\r\\nthe hall where all this passed.  \"Bravo! bravissimo!\"--Francisco thought\\r\\nhe knew the voice and the countenance of this man, who exclaimed with so\\r\\nmuch enthusiasm.  He remembered to have seen him before, but when, or\\r\\nwhere, he could not recollect.  As soon as the count left the hall, the\\r\\nstranger came up to Francisco.  \"Is it possible,\" said he, \"that you\\r\\ndon\\'t know me?  It is scarcely a twelvemonth since I drew tears from your\\r\\neyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tears from my eyes?\" repeated Francisco, smiling; \"I have shed but few\\r\\ntears.  I have had but few misfortunes in my life.\"  The stranger\\r\\nanswered him by two extempore Italian lines, which conveyed nearly the\\r\\nsame idea that has been so well expressed by an English poet:--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"To each their sufferings--all are men\\r\\n         Condemn\\'d alike to groan;\\r\\n      The feeling for another\\'s woes,\\r\\n         Th\\' unfeeling for his own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know you now perfectly well,\" cried Francisco; \"you are the\\r\\nImprovisatore who, one fine moonlight night last summer, told us the\\r\\nstory of Cornaro the Turk.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The same,\" said the Improvisatore; \"the same, though in a better dress,\\r\\nwhich I should not have thought would have made so much difference in\\r\\nyour eyes, though it makes all the difference between man and man in the\\r\\neyes of the stupid vulgar.  My genius has broken through the clouds of\\r\\nmisfortune of late.  A few happy impromptu verses I made on the Count de\\r\\nFlora\\'s fall from his horse attracted attention.  The count patronizes\\r\\nme.  I am here now to learn the fate of an ode I have just composed for\\r\\nhis lady\\'s birthday.  My ode was to have been set to music, and to have\\r\\nbeen performed at his villa near Torre del Greco, if these troubles had\\r\\nnot intervened.  Now that the mountain is quiet again, people will return\\r\\nto their senses.  I expect to be munificently rewarded.  But, perhaps, I\\r\\ndetain you.  Go; I shall not forget to celebrate the heroic action you\\r\\nhave performed this day.  I still amuse myself amongst the populace in my\\r\\ntattered garb late in the evenings, and I shall sound your praises\\r\\nthrough Naples in a poem I mean to recite on the late eruption of Mount\\r\\nVesuvius.  Adieu.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Improvisatore was as good as his word.  That evening, with more than\\r\\nhis usual enthusiasm, he recited his verses to a great crowd of people in\\r\\none of the public squares.  Amongst the crowd were several to whom the\\r\\nname of Francisco was well known, and by whom he was well beloved.  These\\r\\nwere his young companions, who remembered him as a fruit-seller amongst\\r\\nthe little merchants.  They rejoiced to hear his praises, and repeated\\r\\nthe lines with shouts of applause.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us pass.  What is all this disturbance in the streets?\" said a man,\\r\\npushing his way through the crowd.  A lad who held by his arm stopped\\r\\nsuddenly on hearing the name of Francisco, which the people were\\r\\nrepeating with so much enthusiasm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha!  I have found at last a story that interests you more than that of\\r\\nCornaro the Turk,\" cried the Improvisatore, looking in the face of the\\r\\nyouth, who had stopped so suddenly.  \"You are the young man who, last\\r\\nsummer, had liked to have tricked me out of my new hat.  Promise me you\\r\\nwon\\'t touch it now,\" said he, throwing down the hat at his feet, \"or you\\r\\nhear not one word I have to say.  Not one word of the heroic action\\r\\nperformed at the villa of the Count de Flora, near Torre del Greco, this\\r\\nmorning, by Signor Francisco.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"SIGNOR Francisco!\" repeated the lad with disdain.  \"Well, let us hear\\r\\nwhat you have to tell of him,\" added he.  \"Your hat is very safe, I\\r\\npromise you; I shall not touch it.  What of SIGNOR Francisco?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"SIGNOR Francisco I may, without impropriety, call him,\" said the\\r\\nImprovisatore, \"for he is likely to become rich enough to command the\\r\\ntitle from those who might not otherwise respect his merit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Likely to become rich! how?\" said the lad, whom our readers have\\r\\nprobably before this time discovered to be Piedro.  \"How, pray, is he\\r\\nlikely to become rich enough to be a signor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Count de Flora has promised him a liberal portion of all the fine\\r\\nfurniture, plate and jewels that can be saved from his villa at Torre del\\r\\nGreco.  Francisco is gone down hither now with some of the count\\'s\\r\\ndomestics to protect the valuable goods against those villainous\\r\\nplunderers, who robbed their fellow-creatures of what even the flames of\\r\\nVesuvius would spare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, we have had enough of this stuff,\" cried the man whose arm Piedro\\r\\nheld.  \"Come away,\" and he hurried forwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis man was one of the villains against whom the honest orator expressed\\r\\nsuch indignation.  He was one of those with whom Piedro got acquainted\\r\\nduring the time that he was living extravagantly upon the money he gained\\r\\nby the sale of the stolen diamond cross.  That robbery was not\\r\\ndiscovered; and his success, as he called it, hardened him in guilt.  He\\r\\nwas both unwilling and unable to withdraw himself from the bad company\\r\\nwith whom his ill gotten wealth connected him.  He did not consider that\\r\\nbad company leads to the gallows. *\\r\\n\\r\\n* La mala compagnia e quella che mena uomini a la forca.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe universal confusion which followed the eruption of Mount Vesuvius was\\r\\nto these villains a time of rejoicing.  No sooner did Piedro\\'s companion\\r\\nhear of the rich furniture, plate, etc., which the imprudent orator had\\r\\ndescribed as belonging to the Count de Flora\\'s villa, than he longed to\\r\\nmake himself master of the whole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a pity,\" said Piedro, \"that the count has sent Francisco, with his\\r\\nservants down to guard it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And who is this Francisco of whom you seem to stand in so much awe?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A boy, a young lad only, of about my own age; but I know him to be\\r\\nsturdily honest.  The servants we might corrupt; but even the old proverb\\r\\nof \\'Angle with a silver hook,\\' * won\\'t hold good with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n* Pescar col hamo d\\'argento.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if he cannot be won by fair means, he must be conquered by foul,\"\\r\\nsaid the desperate villain; \"but if we offer him rather more than the\\r\\ncount has already promised for his share of the booty, of course he will\\r\\nconsult at once his safety and his interest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Piedro; \"that is not his nature.  I know him from a child, and\\r\\nwe had better think of some other house for to-night\\'s business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None other; none but this,\" cried his companion, with an oath.  \"My mind\\r\\nis determined upon this, and you must obey your leader:  recollect the\\r\\nfate of him who failed me yesterday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe person to whom he alluded was one of the gang of robbers who had been\\r\\nassassinated by his companions for hesitating to commit some crime\\r\\nsuggested by their leader.  No tyranny is so dreadful as that which is\\r\\nexercised by villains over their young accomplices, who become their\\r\\nslaves.  Piedro, who was of a cowardly nature, trembled at the\\r\\nthreatening countenance of his captain, and promised submission.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the course of the morning, inquiries were made secretly amongst the\\r\\ncount\\'s servants; and the two men who were engaged to sit up at the villa\\r\\nthat night along with Francisco, were bribed to second the views of this\\r\\ngang of thieves.  It was agreed that about midnight the robbers should be\\r\\nlet into the house; that Francisco should be tied hand and foot, whilst\\r\\nthey carried off their booty.  \"He is a stubborn chap, though so young, I\\r\\nunderstand,\" said the captain of the robbers to his men; \"but we carry\\r\\nponiards, and know how to use them.  Piedro, you look pale.  You don\\'t\\r\\nrequire to be reminded of what I said to you when we were alone just\\r\\nnow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro\\'s voice failed, and some of his comrades observed that he was\\r\\nyoung and new to the business.  The captain, who, from being his\\r\\npretended friend during his wealthy days, had of late become his tyrant,\\r\\ncast a stern look at Piedro, and bid him be sure to be at the old Jew\\'s,\\r\\nwhich was the place of meeting, in the dusk of the evening.  After saying\\r\\nthis he departed.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro, when he was alone, tried to collect his thoughts--all his\\r\\nthoughts were full of horror.  \"Where am I?\" said he to himself; \"what am\\r\\nI about?  Did I understand rightly what he said about poniards?\\r\\nFrancisco; oh, Francisco!  Excellent, kind, generous Francisco!  Yes, I\\r\\nrecollect your look when you held the bunch of grapes to my lips, as I\\r\\nsat by the sea-shore deserted by all the world; and now, what friends\\r\\nhave I.  Robbers and--\"  The word MURDERERS he could not utter.  He again\\r\\nrecollected what had been said about poniards, and the longer his mind\\r\\nfixed upon the words, and the look that accompanied them, the more he was\\r\\nshocked.  He could not doubt but that it was the serious intention of his\\r\\naccomplices to murder Francisco, if he should make any resistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro had at this moment no friend in the world to whom he could apply\\r\\nfor advice or assistance.  His wretched father died some weeks before\\r\\nthis time, in a fit of intoxication.  Piedro walked up and down the\\r\\nstreet, scarcely capable of thinking, much less of coming to any rational\\r\\nresolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hours passed away, the shadows of the houses lengthened under his\\r\\nfootsteps, the evening came on, and when it grew dusk, after hesitating\\r\\nin great agony of mind for some time, his fear of the robbers\\' vengeance\\r\\nprevailed over every other feeling, and he went at the appointed hour to\\r\\nthe place of meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place of meeting was at the house of that Jew to whom he, several\\r\\nmonths before, sold the diamond cross.  That cross which he thought\\r\\nhimself so lucky to have stolen, and to have disposed of undetected, was,\\r\\nin fact, the cause of his being in his present dreadful situation.  It\\r\\nwas at the Jew\\'s that he connected himself with this gang of robbers, to\\r\\nwhom he was now become an absolute slave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that I dared to disobey!\" said he to himself, with a deep sigh, as\\r\\nhe knocked softly at the back door of the Jew\\'s house.  The back door\\r\\nopened into a narrow, unfrequented street, and some small rooms at this\\r\\nside of the house were set apart for the reception of guests who desired\\r\\nto have their business kept secret.  These rooms were separated by a dark\\r\\npassage from the rest of the house, and numbers of people came to the\\r\\nshop in the front of the house, which looked into a creditable street,\\r\\nwithout knowing anything more, from the ostensible appearance of the\\r\\nshop, than that it was a kind of pawnbroker\\'s, where old clothes, old\\r\\niron, and all sorts of refuse goods, might be disposed of conveniently.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the moment Piedro knocked at the back door, the front shop was full of\\r\\ncustomers; and the Jew\\'s boy, whose office it was to attend to these\\r\\nsignals, let Piedro in, told him that none of his comrades were yet come,\\r\\nand left him in a room by himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was pale and trembling, and felt a cold dew spread over him.  He had a\\r\\nleaden image of Saint Januarius tied round his neck, which, in the midst\\r\\nof his wickedness, he superstitiously preserved as a sort of charm, and\\r\\non this he kept his eyes stupidly fixed, as he sat alone in this gloomy\\r\\nplace.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe listened from time to time, but he heard no noise at the side of the\\r\\nhouse where he was.  His accomplices did not arrive, and, in a sort of\\r\\nimpatient terror, the attendant upon an evil conscience, he flung open\\r\\nthe door of his cell, and groped his way through the passage which he\\r\\nknew led to the public shop.  He longed to hear some noise, and to mix\\r\\nwith the living.  The Jew, when Piedro entered the shop, was bargaining\\r\\nwith a poor, thin-looking man about some gunpowder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t deny that it has been wet,\" said the man, \"but since it was in\\r\\nthe bucket of water, it has been carefully dried.  I tell you the simple\\r\\ntruth, that so soon after the grand eruption of Mount Vesuvius, the\\r\\npeople of Naples will not relish fireworks.  My poor little rockets, and\\r\\neven my Catherine-wheels, will have no effect.  I am glad to part with\\r\\nall I have in this line of business.  A few days ago I had fine things in\\r\\nreadiness for the Countess de Flora\\'s birthday, which was to have been\\r\\ncelebrated at the count\\'s villa.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why do you fix your eyes on me, friend?  What is your discourse to me?\"\\r\\nsaid Piedro, who imagined that the man fixed his eyes upon him as he\\r\\nmentioned the name of the count\\'s villa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know that I fixed my eyes upon you; I was thinking of my\\r\\nfireworks,\" said the poor man, simply.  \"But now that I do look at you\\r\\nand hear your voice, I recollect having had the pleasure of seeing you\\r\\nbefore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When? where?\" said Piedro.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great while ago; no wonder you have forgotten me,\" said the man; \"but\\r\\nI can recall the night to your recollection.  You were in the street with\\r\\nme the night I let off that unlucky rocket, which frightened the horses,\\r\\nand was the cause of overturning a lady\\'s coach.  Don\\'t you remember the\\r\\ncircumstance?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a confused recollection of some such thing,\" said Piedro, in\\r\\ngreat embarrassment; and he looked suspiciously at this man, in doubt\\r\\nwhether he was cunning, and wanted to sound him, or whether he was so\\r\\nsimple as he appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You did not, perhaps, hear, then,\" continued the man, \"that there was a\\r\\ngreat search made, after the overturn, for a fine diamond cross,\\r\\nbelonging to the lady in the carriage?  That lady, though I did not know\\r\\nit till lately, was the Countess de Flora.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know nothing of the matter,\" interrupted Piedro, in great agitation.\\r\\nHis confusion was so marked, that the firework-maker could not avoid\\r\\ntaking notice of it; and a silence of some moments ensued.  The Jew, more\\r\\npractised in dissimulation than Piedro, endeavoured to turn the man\\'s\\r\\nattention back to his rockets and his gunpowder--agreed to take the\\r\\ngunpowder--paid for it in haste, and was, though apparently unconcerned,\\r\\neager to get rid of him.  But this was not so easily done.  The man\\'s\\r\\ncuriosity was excited, and his suspicions of Piedro were increased every\\r\\nmoment by all the dark changes of his countenance.  Piedro, overpowered\\r\\nwith the sense of guilt, surprised at the unexpected mention of the\\r\\ndiamond cross, and of the Count de Flora\\'s villa, stood like one\\r\\nconvicted, and seemed fixed to the spot, without power of motion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to look at the old cambric that you said you had--that would do\\r\\nfor making--that you could let me have cheap for artificial flowers,\"\\r\\nsaid the firework-maker to the Jew; and as he spoke, his eye from time to\\r\\ntime looked towards Piedro.\\r\\n\\r\\nPiedro felt for the leaden image of the saint, which he wore round his\\r\\nneck.  The string which held it cracked, and broke with the pull he gave\\r\\nit.  This slight circumstance affected his terrified and superstitious\\r\\nmind more than all the rest.  He imagined that at this moment his fate\\r\\nwas decided; that Saint Januarius deserted him, and that he was undone.\\r\\nHe precipitately followed the firework-man the instant he left the shop,\\r\\nand seizing hold of his arm, whispered, \"I must speak to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speak, then,\" said the man, astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not here; this way,\" said he, drawing him towards the dark passage:\\r\\n\"what I have to say must not be overheard.  You are going to the Count de\\r\\nFlora\\'s, are not you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am,\" said the man.  He was going there to speak to the countess about\\r\\nsome artificial flowers; but Piedro thought he was going to speak to her\\r\\nabout the diamond cross.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are going to give information against me?  Nay, hear me, I confess\\r\\nthat I purloined that diamond cross; but I can do the count a great\\r\\nservice, upon condition that he pardons me.  His villa is to be attacked\\r\\nthis night by four well armed men.  They will set out five hours hence.\\r\\nI am compelled, under the threat of assassination, to accompany them; but\\r\\nI shall do no more.  I throw myself upon the count\\'s mercy.  Hasten to\\r\\nhim--we have no time to lose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor man, who heard this confession, escaped from Piedro the moment\\r\\nhe loosed his arm.  With all possible expedition he ran to the count\\'s\\r\\npalace in Naples, and related to him all that had been said by Piedro.\\r\\nSome of the count\\'s servants, on whom he could most depend, were at a\\r\\ndistant part of the city attending their mistress, but the English\\r\\ngentleman offered the services of his man Arthur.  Arthur no sooner heard\\r\\nthe business, and understood that Francisco was in danger, than he armed\\r\\nhimself without saying one word, saddled his English horse, and was ready\\r\\nto depart before anyone else had finished their exclamations and\\r\\nconjectures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But we are not to set out yet,\" said the servant; \"it is but four miles\\r\\nto Torre del Greco; the sbirri (officers of justice) are summoned--they\\r\\nare to go with us--we must wait for them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey waited, much against Arthur\\'s inclination, a considerable time for\\r\\nthese sbirri.  At length they set out, and just as they reached the\\r\\nvilla, the flash of the pistol was seen from one of the apartments in the\\r\\nhouse.  The robbers were there.  This pistol was snapped by their captain\\r\\nat poor Francisco, who had bravely asserted that he would, as long as he\\r\\nhad life, defend the property committed to his care.  The pistol missed\\r\\nfire, for it was charged with some of the damaged powder which the Jew\\r\\nhad bought that evening from the firework maker, and which he had sold as\\r\\nexcellent immediately afterwards to his favourite customers--the robbers\\r\\nwho met at his house.\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur, as soon as he perceived the flash of the piece, pressed forward\\r\\nthrough all the apartments, followed by the count\\'s servants and the\\r\\nofficers of justice.  At the sudden appearance of so many armed men, the\\r\\nrobbers stood dismayed.  Arthur eagerly shook Francisco\\'s hand,\\r\\ncongratulating him upon his safety, and did not perceive, till he had\\r\\ngiven him several rough friendly shakes, that his arm was wounded, and\\r\\nthat he was pale with the loss of blood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is not much--only a slight wound,\" said Francisco; \"one that I should\\r\\nhave escaped, if I had been upon my guard; but the sight of a face that I\\r\\nlittle expected to see in such company took from me all presence of mind;\\r\\nand one of the ruffians stabbed me here in the arm, whilst I stood in\\r\\nstupid astonishment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! take me to prison! take me to prison--I am weary of life--I am a\\r\\nwretch not fit to live!\" cried Piedro, holding his hands to be tied by\\r\\nthe sbirri.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning Piedro was conveyed to prison; and as he passed through\\r\\nthe streets of Naples he was met by several of those who had known him\\r\\nwhen he was a child.  \"Ay,\" said they, as he went by, \"his father\\r\\nencouraged him in cheating when he was BUT A CHILD; and see what he is\\r\\ncome to, now he is a man!\"  He was ordered to remain twelve months in\\r\\nsolitary confinement.  His captain and his accomplices were sent to the\\r\\ngalleys, and the Jew was banished from Naples.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, having got these villains out of the way, let us return to\\r\\nhonest Francisco.  His wound was soon healed.  Arthur was no bad surgeon,\\r\\nfor he let his patient get well as fast as he pleased; and Carlo and\\r\\nRosetta nursed him with so much kindness, that he was almost sorry to\\r\\nfind himself perfectly recovered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now that you are able to go out,\" said Francisco\\'s father to him, \"you\\r\\nmust come and look at my new house, my dear son.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your new house, father?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, son, and a charming one it is, and a handsome piece of land near\\r\\nit--all at a safe distance, too, from Mount Vesuvius; and can you guess\\r\\nhow I came by it?--it was given to me for having a good son.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" cried Carlo; \"the inhabitants of Resina, and several who had\\r\\nproperty near Terre del Greco, and whose houses and lives were saved by\\r\\nyour intrepidity in carrying the materials for the fireworks and the\\r\\ngunpowder out of this dangerous place, went in a body to the duke, and\\r\\nrequested that he would mention your name and these facts to the king,\\r\\nwho, amongst the grants he has made to the sufferers by the late eruption\\r\\nof Mount Vesuvius, has been pleased to say that he gives this house and\\r\\ngarden to your father, because you have saved the property and lives of\\r\\nmany of his subjects.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe value of a handsome portion of furniture, plate, etc., in the Count\\r\\nde Flora\\'s villa, was, according to the count\\'s promise, given to him;\\r\\nand this money he divided between his own family and that of the good\\r\\ncarpenter who first put a pencil into his hands.  Arthur would not accept\\r\\nof any present from him.  To Mr. Lee, the English gentleman, he offered\\r\\none of his own drawings--a fruit-piece.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I like this very well,\" said Arthur, as he examined the drawing, \"but I\\r\\nshould like this melon better if it was a little bruised.  It is now\\r\\nthree years ago since I was going to buy that bruised melon from you; you\\r\\nshowed me your honest nature then, though you were but a boy; and I have\\r\\nfound you the same ever since.  A good beginning makes a good ending--an\\r\\nhonest boy will make an honest man; and honesty is the best policy, as\\r\\nyou have proved to all who wanted the proof, I hope.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" added Francisco\\'s father, \"I think it is pretty plain that Piedro\\r\\nthe Cunning has not managed quite so well as Francisco the Honest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTARLTON.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Delightful task! to rear the tender thought,--\\r\\n     To teach the young idea how to shoot,--\\r\\n     To pour the fresh instruction o\\'er the mind,--\\r\\n     To breathe th\\' enlivening spirit,--and to fix\\r\\n     The generous purpose in the glowing breast.\\r\\n                                               THOMSON.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung Hardy was educated by Mr. Freeman, a very excellent master, at one\\r\\nof our rural Sunday schools.  He was honest, obedient, active and good-\\r\\nnatured, hence he was esteemed by his master; and being beloved by all\\r\\nhis companions who were good, he did not desire to be loved by the bad;\\r\\nnor was he at all vexed or ashamed when idle, mischievous or dishonest\\r\\nboys attempted to plague or ridicule him.  His friend Loveit, on the\\r\\ncontrary, wished to be universally liked, and his highest ambition was to\\r\\nbe thought the best natured boy in the school--and so he was.  He usually\\r\\nwent by the name of POOR LOVEIT, and everybody pitied him when he got\\r\\ninto disgrace, which he frequently did, for though he had a good\\r\\ndisposition, he was led to do things which he knew to be wrong merely\\r\\nbecause he could never have the courage to say \"NO,\" because he was\\r\\nafraid to offend the ill-natured, and could not bear to be laughed at by\\r\\nfools.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne fine autumn evening, all the boys were permitted to go out to play in\\r\\na pleasant green meadow near the school.  Loveit and another boy, called\\r\\nTarlton, began to play a game of battledore and shuttlecock, and a large\\r\\nparty stood by to look on, for they were the best players at battledore\\r\\nand shuttlecock in the school, and this was a trial of skill between\\r\\nthem.  When they had got it up to three hundred and twenty, the game\\r\\nbecame very interesting.  The arms of the combatants tired that they\\r\\ncould scarcely wield the battledores.  The shuttlecock began to waver in\\r\\nthe air; now it almost touched the ground, and now, to the astonishment\\r\\nof the spectators, mounted again high over their heads:  yet the strokes\\r\\nbecame feebler and feebler; and \"Now, Loveit!\" \"Now, Tarlton!\" resounded\\r\\non all sides.  For another minute the victory was doubtful; but at length\\r\\nthe setting sun, shining full in Loveit\\'s face, so dazzled his eyes that\\r\\nhe could no longer see the shuttlecock, and it fell at his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first shout for Tarlton\\'s triumph was over, everybody\\r\\nexclaimed, \"Poor Loveit! he\\'s the best natured fellow in the world!  What\\r\\na pity that he did not stand with his back to the sun!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, I dare you all to play another game with me,\" cried Tarlton,\\r\\nvauntingly; and as he spoke, he tossed the shuttlecock up with all his\\r\\nforce--with so much force that it went over the hedge and dropped into a\\r\\nlane, which went close beside the field.  \"Hey-day!\" said Tarlton, \"what\\r\\nshall we do now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boys were strictly forbidden to go into the lane; and it was upon\\r\\ntheir promise not to break this command, that they were allowed to play\\r\\nin the adjoining field.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo other shuttlecock was to be had and their play was stopped.  They\\r\\nstood on the top of the bank, peeping over the hedge.  \"I see it yonder,\"\\r\\nsaid Tarlton; \"I wish somebody would get it.  One could get over the gate\\r\\nat the bottom of the field, and be back again in half a minute,\" added\\r\\nhe, looking at Loveit.  \"But you know we must not go into the lane,\" said\\r\\nLoveit, hesitatingly.  \"Pugh!\" said Tarlton, \"why, now, what harm could\\r\\nit do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Loveit, drumming upon his battledore; \"but--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t know, man! why, then, what are you afraid of, I ask you?\"\\r\\nLoveit coloured, went on drumming, and again, in a lower voice, said \"HE\\r\\nDIDN\\'T KNOW.\"  But upon Tarlton\\'s repeating, in a more insolent tone, \"I\\r\\nask you, man, what you\\'re afraid of?\" he suddenly left off drumming, and\\r\\nlooking round, said, \"he was not afraid of anything that he knew of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but you are,\" said Hardy, coming forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Am I?\" said Loveit; \"of what, pray, am I afraid?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of doing wrong!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Afraid OF DOING WRONG!\" repeated Tarlton, mimicking him, so that he made\\r\\neverybody laugh.  \"Now, hadn\\'t you better say afraid of being flogged?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Hardy, coolly, after the laugh had somewhat subsided, \"I am as\\r\\nlittle afraid of being flogged as you are, Tarlton; but I meant--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No matter what you meant; why should you interfere with your wisdom and\\r\\nyour meanings; nobody thought of asking YOU to stir a step for us; but we\\r\\nasked Loveit, because he\\'s the best fellow in the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And for that very reason you should not ask him, because, you know he\\r\\ncan\\'t refuse you anything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, though,\" cried Loveit, piqued, \"THERE you\\'re mistaken, for I\\r\\ncould refuse if I chose it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHardy smiled; and Loveit, half afraid of his contempt, and half afraid of\\r\\nTarlton\\'s ridicule, stood doubtful, and again had recourse to his\\r\\nbattledore, which he balanced most curiously upon his forefinger.  \"Look\\r\\nat him!--now do look at him!\" cried Tarlton; \"did you ever in your life\\r\\nsee anybody look so silly?--Hardy has him quite under his thumb; he\\'s so\\r\\nmortally afraid of Parson Prig, that he dare not, for the soul of him,\\r\\nturn either of his eyes from the tip of his nose; look how he squints!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t squint,\" said Loveit, looking up, \"and nobody has me under his\\r\\nthumb! and what Hardy said was only for fear I should get in disgrace;\\r\\nhe\\'s the best friend I have.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLoveit spoke this with more than usual spirit, for both his heart and his\\r\\npride were touched.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come along, then,\" said Hardy, taking him by the arm in an affectionate\\r\\nmanner; and he was just going, when Tarlton called after him, \"Ay, go\\r\\nalong with its best friend, and take care it does not get into a scrape;-\\r\\n-good-bye, Little Panado!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whom do they call Little Panado?\" said Loveit, turning his head hastily\\r\\nback.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind,\" said Hardy, \"what does it signify?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Loveit, \"to be sure it does not signify; but one does not like\\r\\nto be called Little Panado:  besides,\" added he, after going a few steps\\r\\nfarther, \"they\\'ll all think it so ill-natured.  I had better go back, and\\r\\njust tell them that I\\'m very sorry I can\\'t get their shuttlecock; do come\\r\\nback with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Hardy, \"I can\\'t go back; and you\\'d better not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, I assure you, I won\\'t stay a minute; wait for me,\" added Loveit;\\r\\nand he slunk back again to prove that he was not Little Panado.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce returned, the rest followed, of course; for to support his character\\r\\nof good-nature he was obliged to yield to the entreaties of his\\r\\ncompanions, and to show his spirit, leapt over the gate, amidst the\\r\\nacclamations of the little mob:--he was quickly out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here,\" cried he, returning in about five minutes, quite out of breath,\\r\\n\"I\\'ve got the shuttlecock; and I\\'ll tell you what I\\'ve seen,\" cried he,\\r\\npanting for breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What?\" cried everybody, eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, just at the turn of the corner, at the end of the lane\"--panting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Tarlton, impatiently, \"do go on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me just take breath first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pugh--never mind your breath.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, just at the turn of the corner, at the end of the lane, as I\\r\\nwas looking about for the shuttlecock, I heard a great rustling somewhere\\r\\nnear me, and so I looked where it could come from; and I saw, in a nice\\r\\nlittle garden, on the opposite side of the way, a boy, about as big as\\r\\nTarlton, sitting in a great tree, shaking the branches:  so I called to\\r\\nthe boy, to beg one; but he said he could not give me one, for that they\\r\\nwere his grandfather\\'s; and just at that minute, from behind a gooseberry\\r\\nbush, up popped the uncle; the grandfather poked his head out of the\\r\\nwindow; so I ran off as fast as my legs would carry me though I heard him\\r\\nbawling after me all the way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And let him bawl,\" cried Tarlton; \"he shan\\'t bawl for nothing; I\\'m\\r\\ndetermined we\\'ll have some of his fine large rosy apples before I sleep\\r\\nto-night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this speech a general silence ensued; everybody kept their eyes fixed\\r\\nupon Tarlton, except Loveit, who looked down, apprehensive that he should\\r\\nbe drawn on much farther than he intended.  \"Oh, indeed!\" said he to\\r\\nhimself, \"as Hardy told me, I had better not have come back!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless of this confusion, Tarlton continued, \"But before I say any\\r\\nmore, I hope we have no spies amongst us.  If there is any one of you\\r\\nafraid to be flogged, let him march off this instant!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLoveit coloured, bit his lips, wished to go, but had not the courage to\\r\\nmove first.  He waited to see what everybody else would do:  nobody\\r\\nstirred; so Loveit stood still.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" cried Tarlton, giving his hand to the boy next him, then to\\r\\nthe next, \"your word and honour that you won\\'t betray me; but stand by\\r\\nme, and I\\'ll stand by you.\"  Each boy gave his hand and his promise;\\r\\nrepeating, \"Stand by me, and I\\'ll stand by you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLoveit hung back till the last; and had almost twisted off the button of\\r\\nthe boy\\'s coat who screened him, when Tarlton came up, holding out his\\r\\nhand, \"Come, Loveit, lad, you\\'re in for it:  stand by me, and I\\'ll stand\\r\\nby you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Tarlton,\" expostulated he, without looking him in the face, \"I\\r\\ndo wish you\\'d give up this scheme; I daresay all the apples are gone by\\r\\nthis time; I wish you would.  Do, pray, give up this scheme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What scheme, man? you have\\'n\\'t heard it yet; you may as well know your\\r\\ntext before you begin preaching.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe corners of Loveit\\'s mouth could not refuse to smile, though in his\\r\\nheart he felt not the slightest inclination to laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I don\\'t know you, I declare I don\\'t know you to-day,\" said Tarlton;\\r\\n\"you used to be the best natured most agreeable lad in the world, and\\r\\nwould do anything one asked you; but you\\'re quite altered of late, as we\\r\\nwere saying just now, when you skulked away with Hardy:  come,--do, man,\\r\\npluck up a little spirit, and be one of us, or you\\'ll make us all HATE\\r\\nYOU.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"HATE me!\" repeated Loveit, with terror; \"no, surely, you won\\'t all HATE\\r\\nme!\" and he mechanically stretched out his hand which Tarlton shook\\r\\nviolently, saying, \"Ay, now, that\\'s right.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, now, that\\'s wrong!\" whispered Loveit\\'s conscience; but his\\r\\nconscience was of no use to him, for it was always overpowered by the\\r\\nvoice of numbers; and though he had the wish, he never had the power, to\\r\\ndo right.  \"Poor Loveit!  I knew he would not refuse us,\" cried his\\r\\ncompanions; and even Tarlton, the moment he shook hands with him,\\r\\ndespised him.  It is certain that weakness of mind is despised both by\\r\\nthe good and the bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe league being thus formed, Tarlton assumed all the airs of commander,\\r\\nexplained his schemes, and laid the plan of attack upon the poor old\\r\\nman\\'s apple-tree.  It was the only one he had the world.  We shall not\\r\\ndwell upon their consultation; for the amusement of contriving such\\r\\nexpeditions is often the chief thing which induces idle boys to engage in\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a small window at the end of the back staircase, through which,\\r\\nbetween nine and ten o\\'clock at night, Tarlton, accompanied by Loveit and\\r\\nanother boy, crept out.  It was a moonlight night, and after crossing the\\r\\nfield, and climbing the gate, directed by Loveit, who now resolved to go\\r\\nthrough the affair with spirit, they proceeded down the lane with rash\\r\\nyet fearful steps.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a distance Loveit saw the white washed cottage, and the apple-tree\\r\\nbeside it.  They quickened their pace, and with some difficulty scrambled\\r\\nthrough the hedge which fenced the garden, though not without being\\r\\nscratched and torn by the briers.  Everything was silent.  Yet now and\\r\\nthen, at every rustling of the leaves, they started, and their hearts\\r\\nbeat violently.  Once, as Loveit was climbing the apple-tree, he thought\\r\\nhe heard a door in the cottage open, and earnestly begged his companions\\r\\nto desist and return home.  This, however, he could by no means persuade\\r\\nthem to do, until they had filled their pockets with apples; then, to his\\r\\ngreat joy, they returned, crept in at the window and each retired, as\\r\\nsoftly as possible, to his own apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoveit slept in the room with Hardy, whom he had left fast asleep, and\\r\\nwhom he now was extremely afraid of awakening.  All the apples were\\r\\nemptied out of Loveit\\'s pockets, and lodged with Tarlton till the\\r\\nmorning, for fear the smell should betray the secret to Hardy.  The room\\r\\ndoor was apt to creak, but it was opened with such precaution, that no\\r\\nnoise could be heard, and Loveit found his friend as fast asleep as when\\r\\nhe left him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah,\" said he to himself, \"how quietly he sleeps!  I wish I had been\\r\\nsleeping too.\"  The reproaches of Loveit\\'s conscience, however, served no\\r\\nother purpose but to torment him; he had not sufficient strength of mind\\r\\nto be good.  The very next night, in spite of all his fears, and all his\\r\\npenitence, and all his resolutions, by a little fresh ridicule and\\r\\npersuasion he was induced to accompany the same party on a similar\\r\\nexpedition.  We must observe, that the necessity for continuing their\\r\\ndepredations became stronger the third day; for, though at first only a\\r\\nsmall party had been in the secret, by degrees it was divulged to the\\r\\nwhole school; and it was necessary to secure secrecy by sharing the\\r\\nbooty.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone was astonished that Hardy, with all his quickness and\\r\\npenetration, had not yet discovered their proceedings; but Loveit could\\r\\nnot help suspecting that he was not quite so ignorant as he appeared to\\r\\nbe.  Loveit had strictly kept his promise of secrecy; but he was by no\\r\\nmeans an artful boy; and in talking to his friend, conscious that he had\\r\\nsomething to conceal, he was perpetually on the point of betraying\\r\\nhimself; then recollecting his engagement, he blushed, stammered,\\r\\nbungled; and upon Hardy\\'s asking what he meant, would answer with a\\r\\nsilly, guilty countenance, that he did not know; or abruptly break off,\\r\\nsaying, \"Oh nothing! nothing at all!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in vain that he urged Tarlton to permit him to consult his friend.\\r\\nA gloom overspread Tarlton\\'s brow when he began to speak on the subject,\\r\\nand he always returned a peremptory refusal, accompanied with some such\\r\\ntaunting expression as this--\"I wish we had nothing to do with such a\\r\\nsneaking fellow; he\\'ll betray us all, I see, before we have done with\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Loveit to himself, \"so I am abused after all, and called a\\r\\nsneaking fellow for my pains; that\\'s rather hard, to be sure, when I\\'ve\\r\\ngot so little by the job.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn truth he had not got much; for in the division of the booty only one\\r\\napple, and half of another, which was only half ripe, happened to fall to\\r\\nhis share; though, to be sure, when they had all eaten their apples, he\\r\\nhad the satisfaction to hear everybody declare they were very sorry they\\r\\nhad forgotten to offer some of theirs to \"POOR LOVEIT.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, the visits to the apple-tree had been now too frequently\\r\\nrepeated to remain concealed from the old man who lived in the cottage.\\r\\nHe used to examine his only tree very frequently, and missing numbers of\\r\\nrosy apples, which he had watched ripening, he, though not prone to\\r\\nsuspicion, began to think that there was something going wrong;\\r\\nespecially as a gap was made in his hedge, and there were several small\\r\\nfootsteps in his flower beds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good old man was not at all inclined to give pain to any living\\r\\ncreature, much less to children, of whom he was particularly fond.  Nor\\r\\nwas he in the least avaricious, for though he was not rich, he had enough\\r\\nto live upon, because he had been very industrious in his youth; and he\\r\\nwas always very ready to part with the little he had.  Nor was he a cross\\r\\nold man.  If anything would have made him angry, it would have been the\\r\\nseeing his favourite tree robbed, as he had promised himself the pleasure\\r\\nof giving his red apples to his grandchildren on his birthday.  However,\\r\\nhe looked up at the tree in sorrow rather than in anger, and leaning upon\\r\\nhis staff, he began to consider what he had best do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I complain to their master,\" said he to himself, \"they will certainly\\r\\nbe flogged, and that I should be sorry for:  yet they must not be let to\\r\\ngo on stealing; that would be worse still, for it would surely bring them\\r\\nto the gallows in the end.  Let me see--oh, ay, that will do; I will\\r\\nborrow farmer Kent\\'s dog Barker, he\\'ll keep them off, I\\'ll answer for\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFarmer Kent lent his dog Barker, cautioning his neighbour, at the same\\r\\ntime, to be sure to chain him well, for he was the fiercest mastiff in\\r\\nEngland.  The old man, with farmer Kent\\'s assistance, chained him fast to\\r\\nthe trunk of the apple-tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nNight came; and Tarlton, Loveit and his companions, returned at the usual\\r\\nhour.  Grown bolder now by frequent success, they came on talking and\\r\\nlaughing.  But the moment they had set their foot in the garden, the dog\\r\\nstarted up; and, shaking the chain as he sprang forward, barked with\\r\\nunremitting fury.  They stood still as if fixed to the spot.  There was\\r\\njust moonlight enough to see the dog.  \"Let us try the other side of the\\r\\ntree,\" said Tarlton.  But to whichever side they turned, the dog flew\\r\\nround in an instant, barking with increased fury.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'ll break his chain and tear us to pieces,\" cried Tarlton; and, struck\\r\\nwith terror, he immediately threw down the basket he had brought with\\r\\nhim, and betook himself to flight, with the greatest precipitation.\\r\\n\"Help me! oh, pray, help me!  I can\\'t get through the hedge,\" cried\\r\\nLoveit, in a lamentable tone, whilst the dog growled hideously, and\\r\\nsprang forward to the extremity of his chain.  \"I can\\'t get out!  Oh, for\\r\\nGod\\'s sake, stay for me one minute, dear Tarlton!\"  He called in vain; he\\r\\nwas left to struggle through his difficulties by himself; and of all his\\r\\ndear friends not one turned back to help him.  At last, torn and\\r\\nterrified, he got through the hedge and ran home, despising his\\r\\ncompanions for their selfishness.  Nor could he help observing that\\r\\nTarlton, with all his vaunted prowess, was the first to run away from the\\r\\nappearance of danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning Loveit could not help reproaching the party with their\\r\\nconduct.  \"Why could not you, any of you, stay one minute to help me?\"\\r\\nsaid he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We did not hear you call,\" answered one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was so frightened,\" said another, \"I would not have turned back for\\r\\nthe whole world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you, Tarlton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I,\" said Tarlton; \"had not I enough to do to take care of myself, you\\r\\nblockhead?  Everyone for himself in this world!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I see,\" said Loveit, gravely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, man! is there anything strange in that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strange! why, yes; I thought you all loved me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord love you, lad! so we do; but we love ourselves better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hardy would not have served me so, however,\" said Loveit, turning away\\r\\nin disgust.  Tarlton was alarmed.  \"Pugh!\" said he; \"what nonsense have\\r\\nyou taken into your brain!  Think no more about it.  We are all very\\r\\nsorry, and beg your pardon; come, shake hands, forgive and forget.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLoveit gave his hand, but gave it rather coldly.  \"I forgive it with all\\r\\nmy heart,\" said he; \"but I cannot forget it so soon!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, then, you are not such a good humoured fellow as we thought you\\r\\nwere.  Surely you cannot bear malice, Loveit.\"  Loveit smiled, and\\r\\nallowed that he certainly could not bear malice.  \"Well, then, come; you\\r\\nknow at the bottom we all love you, and would do anything in the world\\r\\nfor you.\"  Poor Loveit, flattered in his foible, began to believe that\\r\\nthey did love him at the bottom, as they said, and even with his eyes\\r\\nopen consented again to be duped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How strange it is,\" thought he, \"that I should set such value upon the\\r\\nlove of those I despise!  When I\\'m once out of this scrape, I\\'ll have no\\r\\nmore to do with them, I\\'m determined.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCompared with his friend Hardy, his new associates did indeed appear\\r\\ncontemptible; for all this time Hardy had treated him with uniform\\r\\nkindness, avoided to pry into his secrets, yet seemed ready to receive\\r\\nhis confidence, if it had been offered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter school in the evening, as he was standing silently beside Hardy,\\r\\nwho was ruling a sheet of paper for him, Tarlton, in his brutal manner,\\r\\ncame up, and seizing him by the arm, cried, \"Come along with me, Loveit,\\r\\nI\\'ve something to say to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t come now,\" said Loveit, drawing away his arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, do come now,\" said Tarlton, in a voice of persuasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'ll come presently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, but do, pray; there\\'s a good fellow, come now, because I have\\r\\nsomething to say to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it you\\'ve got to say to me?  I wish you\\'d let me alone,\" said\\r\\nLoveit; yet at the same time he suffered himself to he led away.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarlton took particular pains to humour him and bring him into temper\\r\\nagain; and even though he was not very apt to part with his playthings,\\r\\nwent so far as to say, \"Loveit, the other day you wanted a top; I\\'ll give\\r\\nyou mine if you desire it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLoveit thanked him, and was overjoyed at the thought of possessing this\\r\\ntop.  \"But what did you want to say to me just now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, we\\'ll talk of that presently; not yet--when we get out of hearing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nobody is near us,\" said Loveit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come a little farther however,\" said Tarlton, looking round\\r\\nsuspiciously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well now, well?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know the dog that frightened us last night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will never frighten us again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Won\\'t it? how so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here,\" said Tarlton, drawing something from his pocket wrapped in a\\r\\nblue handkerchief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that?\"  Tarlton opened it.  \"Raw meat!\" exclaimed Loveit.  \"How\\r\\ncame you by it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tom, the servant boy, Tom got it for me; and I\\'m to give him sixpence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is it for the dog?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; I vowed I\\'d be revenged on him, and after this he\\'ll never bark\\r\\nagain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never bark again!  What do you mean?  Is it poison?\" exclaimed Loveit,\\r\\nstarting back with horror.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only poison for A DOG,\" said Tarlton, confused; \"you could not look more\\r\\nshocking if it was poison for a Christian.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLoveit stood for nearly a minute in profound silence.  \"Tarlton,\" said he\\r\\nat last, in a changed tone and altered manner, \"I did not know you; I\\r\\nwill have no more to do with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, but stay,\" said Tarlton, catching hold of his arm, \"stay; I was\\r\\nonly joking.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let go my arm--you were in earnest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But then that was before I knew there was any harm.  If you think\\r\\nthere\\'s any harm?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"IF,\" said Loveit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, you know, I might not know; for Tom told me it\\'s a thing that\\'s\\r\\noften done.  Ask Tom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll ask nobody!  Surely we know better what\\'s right and wrong than Tom\\r\\ndoes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But only just ask him, to hear what he\\'ll say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t want to hear what he\\'ll say,\" cried Loveit, vehemently:  \"the\\r\\ndog will die in agonies--in agonies!  There was a dog poisoned at my\\r\\nfather\\'s--I saw him in the yard.  Poor creature!  He lay and howled and\\r\\nwrithed himself!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor creature!  Well, there\\'s no harm done now,\" cried Tarlton, in a\\r\\nhypocritical tone.  But though he thought fit to dissemble with Loveit,\\r\\nhe was thoroughly determined in his purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Loveit, in haste to get away, returned to his friend Hardy; but his\\r\\nmind was in such agitation, that he neither talked nor moved like\\r\\nhimself; and two or three times his heart was so full that he was ready\\r\\nto burst into tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How good-natured you are to me,\" said he to Hardy, as he was trying\\r\\nvainly to entertain him; \"but if you knew--\"  Here he stopped short, for\\r\\nthe bell for evening prayer rang, and they all took their places, and\\r\\nknelt down.  After prayers, as they were going to bed, Loveit stopped\\r\\nTarlton,--\"WELL!\" asked he, in an inquiring manner, fixing his eyes upon\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"WELL!\" replied Tarlton, in an audacious tone, as if he meant to set his\\r\\ninquiring eye at defiance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean to do to-night?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To go to sleep, as you do, I suppose,\" replied Tarlton, turning away\\r\\nabruptly, and whistling as he walked off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, he has certainly changed his mind!\" said Loveit to himself, \"else he\\r\\ncould not whistle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout ten minutes after this, as he and Hardy were undressing, Hardy\\r\\nsuddenly recollected that he had left his new kite out upon the grass.\\r\\n\"Oh,\" said he, \"it will be quite spoiled before morning!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Call Tom,\" said Loveit, \"and bid him bring it in for you in a minute.\"\\r\\nThey both went to the top of the stairs to call Tom; no one answered.\\r\\nThey called again louder, \"Is Tom below?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m here,\" answered he at last, coming out of Tarlton\\'s room with a look\\r\\nof mixed embarrassment and effrontery.  And as he was receiving Hardy\\'s\\r\\ncommission, Loveit saw the corner of the blue handkerchief hanging out of\\r\\nhis pocket.  This excited fresh suspicions in Loveit\\'s mind; but, without\\r\\nsaying one word, he immediately stationed himself at the window in his\\r\\nroom, which looked out towards the lane; and, as the moon was risen, he\\r\\ncould see if anyone passed that way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What are you doing there?\" said Hardy, after he had been watching some\\r\\ntime; \"why don\\'t you come to bed?\"  Loveit returned no answer, but\\r\\ncontinued standing at the window.  Nor did he watch long in vain.\\r\\nPresently he saw Tom gliding slowly along a by-path, and get over the\\r\\ngate into the lane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s gone to do it!\" exclaimed Loveit aloud, with an emotion which he\\r\\ncould not command.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who\\'s gone? to do what?\" cried Hardy, starting up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How cruel! how wicked!\" continued Loveit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s cruel--what\\'s wicked? speak out at once!\" returned Hardy, in that\\r\\ncommanding tone which, in moments of danger, strong minds feel themselves\\r\\nentitled to assume towards weak ones.  Loveit instantly, though in an\\r\\nincoherent manner, explained the affair to him.  Scarcely had the words\\r\\npassed his lips, when Hardy sprang up, and began dressing himself without\\r\\nsaying one syllable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For God\\'s sake, what are you going to do?\" said Loveit, in great\\r\\nanxiety.  \"They\\'ll never forgive me! don\\'t betray me! they\\'ll never\\r\\nforgive! pray, speak to me! only say you won\\'t betray us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not betray you, trust to me,\" said Hardy:  and he left the room,\\r\\nand Loveit stood in amazement; while, in the meantime, Hardy, in hopes of\\r\\novertaking Tom before the fate of the poor dog was decided, ran with all\\r\\npossible speed across the meadow, then down the lane.  He came up with\\r\\nTom just as he was climbing the bank into the old man\\'s garden.  Hardy,\\r\\ntoo much out of breath to speak, seized hold of him, dragged him down,\\r\\ndetaining him with a firm grasp, whilst he panted for utterance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, Master Hardy, is it you? what\\'s the matter? what do you want?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want the poisoned meat that you have in your pocket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who told you that I had any such thing?\" said Tom, clapping his hand\\r\\nupon his guilty pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Give it me quietly, and I\\'ll let you off.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir, upon my word I haven\\'t!  I didn\\'t!  I don\\'t know what you mean,\"\\r\\nsaid Tom, trembling, though he was by far the stronger of the two.\\r\\n\"Indeed, I don\\'t know what you mean.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You do,\" said Hardy, with great indignation:  and a violent struggle\\r\\nimmediately commenced.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dog, now alarmed by the voices, began to bark outrageously.  Tom was\\r\\nterrified lest the old man should come out to see what was the matter;\\r\\nhis strength forsook him, and flinging the handkerchief and meat over the\\r\\nhedge, he ran away with all his speed.  The handkerchief fell within\\r\\nreach of the dog, who instantly snapped at it; luckily it did not come\\r\\nuntied.  Hardy saw a pitchfork on a dunghill close beside him, and,\\r\\nseizing upon it, stuck it into the handkerchief.  The dog pulled, tore,\\r\\ngrowled, grappled, yelled; it was impossible to get the handkerchief from\\r\\nbetween his teeth; but the knot was loosed, the meat, unperceived by the\\r\\ndog, dropped out, and while he dragged off the handkerchief in triumph,\\r\\nHardy, with inexpressible joy, plunged the pitchfork into the poisoned\\r\\nmeat, and bore it away.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever did hero retire with more satisfaction from a field of battle.\\r\\nFull of the pleasure of successful benevolence, Hardy tripped joyfully\\r\\nhome, and vaulted over the window sill, when the first object he beheld\\r\\nwas Mr. Power, the usher, standing at the head of the stairs, with his\\r\\ncandle in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come up, whoever you are,\" said Mr. William Power, in a stern voice.  \"I\\r\\nthought I should find you out at last.  Come up, whoever you are!\"  Hardy\\r\\nobeyed without reply.--\"Hardy!\" exclaimed Mr. Power, starting back with\\r\\nastonishment; \"is it you, Mr. Hardy?\" repeated he, holding the light to\\r\\nhis face.  \"Why, sir,\" said he, in a sneering tone, \"I\\'m sure if Mr.\\r\\nTrueman was here he wouldn\\'t believe his own eyes; but for my part I saw\\r\\nthrough you long since; I never liked saints, for my share.  Will you\\r\\nplease to do me the favour, sir, if it is not too much trouble, to empty\\r\\nyour pockets.\"  Hardy obeyed in silence.  \"Heyday! meat! raw meat! what\\r\\nnext?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s all,\" said Hardy, emptying his pockets inside out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is ALL,\" said Mr. Power, taking up the meat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, sir,\" said Hardy, eagerly, \"let that meat be burned, it is\\r\\npoisoned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poisoned!\" cried Mr. William Power, letting it drop out of his fingers;\\r\\n\"you wretch!\" looking at him with a menacing air:  \"what is all this?\\r\\nSpeak.\"  Hardy was silent.  \"Why don\\'t you speak?\" cried he, shaking him\\r\\nby the shoulder impatiently.  Still Hardy was silent.  \"Down upon your\\r\\nknees this minute and confess all:  tell me where you\\'ve been, what\\r\\nyou\\'ve been doing, and who are your accomplices, for I know there is a\\r\\ngang of you; so,\" added he, pressing heavily upon Hardy\\'s shoulder, \"down\\r\\nupon your knees this minute, and confess the whole, that\\'s your only way\\r\\nnow to get off yourself.  If you hope for MY pardon, I can tell you it\\'s\\r\\nnot to be had without asking for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir,\" said Hardy, in a firm but respectful voice, \"I have no pardon to\\r\\nask, I have nothing to confess; I am innocent; but if I were not, I would\\r\\nnever try to get off myself by betraying my companions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, sir! very well! very fine! stick to it, stick to it, I advise\\r\\nyou, and we shall see.  And how will you look to-morrow, Mr. Innocent,\\r\\nwhen my uncle, the doctor, comes home?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I do now, sir,\" said Hardy, unmoved.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis composure threw Mr. Power into a rage too great for utterance.\\r\\n\"Sir,\" continued Hardy, \"ever since I have been at school, I never told a\\r\\nlie, and therefore, sir, I hope you will believe me now.  Upon my word\\r\\nand honour, sir, I have done nothing wrong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing wrong?  Better and better! what, when I caught you going out at\\r\\nnight?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THAT, to be sure, was wrong,\" said Hardy, recollecting himself; \"but\\r\\nexcept that--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Except that, sir! I will except nothing.  Come along with me, young\\r\\ngentleman, your time for pardon is past.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSaying these words, he pulled Hardy along a narrow passage to a small\\r\\ncloset, set apart for desperate offenders, and usually known by the name\\r\\nof the BLACK HOLE.  \"There, sir, take up your lodging there for to-\\r\\nnight,\" said he, pushing him in; \"tomorrow I\\'ll know more, or I\\'ll know\\r\\nwhy,\" added he, double locking the door, with a tremendous noise, upon\\r\\nhis prisoner, and locking also the door at the end of the passage, so\\r\\nthat no one could have access to him.  \"So now I think I have you safe!\"\\r\\nsaid Mr. William Power to himself, stalking off with steps which made the\\r\\nwhole gallery resound, and which made many a guilty heart tremble.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation which had passed between Hardy and Mr. Power at the head\\r\\nof the stairs had been anxiously listened to; but only a word or two here\\r\\nand there had been distinctly overheard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe locking of the black hole door was a terrible sound--some knew not\\r\\nwhat it portended, and others knew TOO WELL.  All assembled in the\\r\\nmorning with faces of anxiety.  Tarlton and Loveit\\'s were the most\\r\\nagitated:  Tarlton for himself, Loveit for his friend, for himself, for\\r\\neverybody.  Every one of the party, and Tarlton at their head, surrounded\\r\\nhim with reproaches; and considered him as the author of the evils which\\r\\nhung over them.  \"How could you do so? and why did you say anything to\\r\\nHardy about it? when you had promised, too!  Oh! what shall we all do?\\r\\nwhat a scrape you have brought us into, Loveit, it\\'s all your fault!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"ALL MY FAULT!\" repeated poor Loveit, with a sigh; \"well, that is hard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Goodness! there\\'s the bell,\" exclaimed a number of voices at once.  \"Now\\r\\nfor it!\"  They all stood in a half circle for morning prayers.  They\\r\\nlistened--\"Here he is coming!  No--Yes--Here he is!\"  And Mr. William\\r\\nPower, with a gloomy brow, appeared and walked up to his place at the\\r\\nhead of the room.  They knelt down to prayers, and the moment they rose,\\r\\nMr. William Power, laying his hand upon the table, cried, \"Stand still,\\r\\ngentlemen, if you please.\"  Everybody stood stock still; he walked out of\\r\\nthe circle; they guessed that he was gone for Hardy, and the whole room\\r\\nwas in commotion.  Each with eagerness asked each what none could answer,\\r\\n\"HAS HE TOLD?\"  \"WHAT has he told?\"  \"Who has he told of?\"  \"I hope he\\r\\nhas not told of me,\" cried they.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll answer for it he has told of all of us,\" said Tarlton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I\\'ll answer for it he has told of none of us,\" answered Loveit, with\\r\\na sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t think he\\'s such a fool, when he can get himself off,\" said\\r\\nTarlton.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant the prisoner was led in, and as he passed through the\\r\\ncircle, every eye was fixed upon him.  His eye fell upon no one, not even\\r\\nupon Loveit, who pulled him by the coat as he passed--everyone felt\\r\\nalmost afraid to breathe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, sir,\" said Mr. Power, sitting down in Mr. Trueman\\'s elbow-chair,\\r\\nand placing the prisoner opposite to him; \"well, sir, what have you to\\r\\nsay to me this morning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing, sir,\" answered Hardy, in a decided, yet modest manner; \"nothing\\r\\nbut what I said last night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing more?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing more, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I have something more to say to you, sir, then; and a great deal\\r\\nmore, I promise you, before I have done with you;\" and then, seizing him\\r\\nin a fury, he was just going to give him a severe flogging, when the\\r\\nschoolroom door opened, and Mr. Trueman appeared, followed by an old man\\r\\nwhom Loveit immediately knew.  He leaned upon his stick as he walked, and\\r\\nin his other hand carried a basket of apples.  When they came within the\\r\\ncircle, Mr. Trueman stopped short.  \"Hardy!\" exclaimed he, with a voice\\r\\nof unfeigned surprise, whilst Mr. William Power stood with his hand\\r\\nsuspended.--\"Ay, Hardy, sir,\" repeated he.  \"I told him you\\'d not believe\\r\\nyour own eyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Trueman advanced with a slow step.  \"Now, sir, give me leave,\" said\\r\\nthe usher, eagerly drawing him aside, and whispering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, sir,\" said Mr. T. when the whisper was done, addressing himself to\\r\\nHardy, with a voice and manner which, had he been guilty, must have\\r\\npierced him to the heart, \"I find I have been deceived in you; it is but\\r\\nthree hours ago that I told your uncle I never had a boy in my school in\\r\\nwhom I placed so much confidence; but, after all this show of honour and\\r\\nintegrity, the moment my back is turned, you are the first to set an\\r\\nexample of disobedience of my orders.  Why do I talk of disobeying my\\r\\ncommands--you are a thief!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I, sir?\" exclaimed Hardy, no longer able to repress his feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You, sir,--you and some others,\" said Mr. Trueman, looking round the\\r\\nroom with a penetrating glance--\"you and some others.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay, sir,\" interrupted Mr. William Power, \"get that out of him if you\\r\\ncan--ask him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will ask him nothing; I shall neither put his truth nor his honour to\\r\\nthe trial; truth and honour are not to be expected amongst thieves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not a thief!  I have never had anything to do with thieves,\" cried\\r\\nHardy, indignantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you not robbed this old man?  Don\\'t you know the taste of these\\r\\napples?\" said Mr. Trueman, taking one out of the basket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir; I do not.  I never touched one of that old man\\'s apples.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never touched one of them!  I suppose this is some vile equivocation;\\r\\nyou have done worse, you have had the barbarity, the baseness, to attempt\\r\\nto poison his dog; the poisoned meat was found in your pocket last\\r\\nnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The poisoned meat was found in my pocket, sir; but I never intended to\\r\\npoison the dog--I saved his life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lord bless him!\" said the old man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nonsense--cunning!\" said Mr. Power.  \"I hope you won\\'t let him impose\\r\\nupon you, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, he cannot impose upon me; I have a proof he is little prepared for,\"\\r\\nsaid Mr. Trueman, producing the blue handkerchief in which the meat had\\r\\nbeen wrapped.\\r\\n\\r\\nTarlton turned pale; Hardy\\'s countenance never changed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you know this handkerchief, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it not yours?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you know whose it is?\" cried Mr. Power.  Hardy was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Trueman, \"I am not fond of punishing you; but\\r\\nwhen I do it, you know, it is always in earnest.  I will begin with the\\r\\neldest of you; I will begin with Hardy, and flog you with my own hands\\r\\ntill this handkerchief is owned.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sure it\\'s not mine,\" and \"I\\'m sure it\\'s none of mine,\" burst from\\r\\nevery mouth, whilst they looked at each other in dismay; for none but\\r\\nHardy, Loveit and Tarlton knew the secret.  \"My cane,\" said Mr. Trueman,\\r\\nand Mr. Power handed him the cane.  Loveit groaned from the bottom of his\\r\\nheart.  Tarlton leaned back against the wall with a black countenance.\\r\\nHardy looked with a steady eye at the cane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But first,\" said Mr. Trueman, laying down the cane, \"let us see.\\r\\nPerhaps we may find out the owner of this handkerchief another way,\"\\r\\nexamining the corners.  It was torn almost to pieces; but luckily the\\r\\ncorner that was marked remained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"J. T.!\" cried Mr. Trueman.  Every eye turned upon the guilty Tarlton,\\r\\nwho, now as pale as ashes and trembling in every limb, sank down upon his\\r\\nknees, and in a whining voice begged for mercy.  \"Upon my word and\\r\\nhonour, sir, I\\'ll tell you all; I\\'d never have thought of stealing the\\r\\napples if Loveit had not first told me of them; and it was Tom who first\\r\\nput the poisoning the dog into my head.  It was he that carried the meat,\\r\\nWASN\\'T IT?\" said he, appealing to Hardy, whose word he knew must be\\r\\nbelieved.  \"Oh, dear sir!\" continued he as Mr. Trueman began to move\\r\\ntowards him, \"do let me off; pray do let me off this time!  I\\'m not the\\r\\nonly one, indeed, sir! I hope you won\\'t make me an example for the rest.\\r\\nIt\\'s very hard I\\'m to be flogged more than they!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m not going to flog you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Tarlton, getting up and wiping his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You need not thank me,\" said Mr. Trueman.  \"Take your handkerchief--go\\r\\nout of this room--out of this house; let me never see you more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I had any hopes of him,\" said Mr. Trueman, as he shut the door after\\r\\nhim;--\"if I had any hopes of him, I would have punished him;--but I have\\r\\nnone.  Punishment is meant only to make people better; and those who have\\r\\nany hopes of themselves will know how to submit to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt these words Loveit first, and immediately all the rest of the guilty\\r\\nparty, stepped out of the ranks, confessed their fault, and declared\\r\\nthemselves ready to bear any punishment their master thought proper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, they have been punished enough,\" said the old man; \"forgive them,\\r\\nsir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHardy looked as if he wished to speak.  \"Not because you ask it,\" said\\r\\nMr. Trueman to the guilty penitents, \"though I should be glad to oblige\\r\\nyou--it wouldn\\'t be just; but there,\" pointing to Hardy, \"there is one\\r\\nwho has merited a reward; the highest I can give him is that of pardoning\\r\\nhis companions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHardy bowed and his face glowed with pleasure, whilst everybody present\\r\\nsympathized in his feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure,\" thought Loveit, \"this is a lesson I shall never forget.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the old man, with a faltering voice, \"it wasn\\'t for the\\r\\nsake of my apples that I spoke; and you, sir,\" said he to Hardy, \"I thank\\r\\nyou for saving my dog.  If you please, I\\'ll plant on that mount, opposite\\r\\nthe window, a young apple-tree, from my old one.  I will water it, and\\r\\ntake care of it with my own hands for your sake, as long as I am able.\\r\\nAnd may God bless you!\" laying his trembling hand on Hardy\\'s head; \"may\\r\\nGod bless you--I\\'m sure God WILL bless all such boys as you are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BASKET-WOMAN.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Toute leur etude etait de se complaire et de s\\'entr\\'aider.\" *\\r\\n                                              PAUL ET VIRGINIE.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the foot of a steep, slippery, white hill, near Dunstable, in\\r\\nBedfordshire, called Chalk Hill, there is a hut, or rather a hovel, which\\r\\ntravellers could scarcely suppose could be inhabited, if they did not see\\r\\nthe smoke rising from its peaked roof.  An old woman lives in this hovel,\\r\\n** and with her a little boy and girl, the children of a beggar who died,\\r\\nand left these orphans perishing with hunger.  They thought themselves\\r\\nvery happy when the good old woman first took them into her hut and bid\\r\\nthem warm themselves at her small fire, and gave them a crust of mouldy\\r\\nbread to eat.  She had not much to give, but what she had she gave with\\r\\ngood-will.  She was very kind to these poor children, and worked hard at\\r\\nher spinning-wheel and at her knitting, to support herself and them.  She\\r\\nearned money also in another way.  She used to follow all the carriages\\r\\nas they went up Chalk Hill, and when the horses stopped to take breath or\\r\\nto rest themselves, she put stones behind the carriage wheels to prevent\\r\\nthem from rolling backwards down the steep, slippery hill.\\r\\n\\r\\n* \"Their whole study was how to please and to help one another.\"\\r\\n** This was about the close of the 18th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little boy and girl loved to stand beside the good natured old\\r\\nwoman\\'s spinning-wheel when she was spinning, and to talk to her.  At\\r\\nthese times she taught them something, which, she said, she hoped they\\r\\nwould remember all their lives.  She explained to them what is meant by\\r\\ntelling the truth, and what it is to be honest.  She taught them to\\r\\ndislike idleness, and to wish that they could be useful.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening, as they were standing beside her, the little boy said to\\r\\nher, \"Grandmother,\" for that was the name by which she liked that these\\r\\nchildren should call her--\"grandmother, how often you are forced to get\\r\\nup from your spinning-wheel, and to follow the chaises and coaches up\\r\\nthat steep hill, to put stones underneath the wheels, to hinder them from\\r\\nrolling back!  The people who are in the carriages give you a halfpenny\\r\\nor a penny for doing this, don\\'t they?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is very hard work for you to go up and down that hill.  You often\\r\\nsay that you are tired, and then you know that you cannot spin all that\\r\\ntime.  Now if we might go up the hill, and put the stones behind the\\r\\nwheels, you could sit still at your work, and would not the people give\\r\\nus the halfpence? and could not we bring them all to you?  Do, pray, dear\\r\\ngrandmother, try us for one day--to-morrow, will you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the old woman; \"I will try what you can do; but I must go up\\r\\nthe hill along with you for the first two or three times, for fear you\\r\\nshould get yourselves hurt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, the next day, the little boy and girl went with their grandmother, as\\r\\nthey used to call her, up the steep hill; and she showed the boy how to\\r\\nprevent the wheels from rolling back, by putting stones behind them; and\\r\\nshe said, \"This is called scotching the wheels;\" and she took off the\\r\\nboy\\'s hat and gave it to the little girl, to hold up to the carriage-\\r\\nwindows, ready for the halfpence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she thought that the children knew how to manage by themselves, she\\r\\nleft them, and returned to her spinning-wheel.  A great many carriages\\r\\nhappened to go by this day, and the little girl received a great many\\r\\nhalfpence.  She carried them all in her brother\\'s hat to her grandmother\\r\\nin the evening; and the old woman smiled, and thanked the children.  She\\r\\nsaid that they had been useful to her, and that her spinning had gone on\\r\\nfinely, because she had been able to sit still at her wheel all day.\\r\\n\"But, Paul my boy,\" said she, \"what is the matter with your hand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only a pinch--only one pinch that I got, as I was putting a stone behind\\r\\na wheel of a chaise.  It does not hurt me much, grandmother; and I\\'ve\\r\\nthought of a good thing for to-morrow.  I shall never be hurt again, if\\r\\nyou will only be so good as to give me the old handle of the broken\\r\\ncrutch, grandmother, and the block of wood that lies in the chimney-\\r\\ncorner, and that is of no use.  I\\'ll make it of some use, if I may have\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take it then, dear,\" said the old woman; \"and you\\'ll find the handle of\\r\\nthe broken crutch under my bed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul went to work immediately, and fastened one end of the pole into the\\r\\nblock of wood, so as to make something like a dry-rubbing brush.  \"Look,\\r\\ngrandmamma, look at my SCOTCHER.  I call this thing my SCOTCHER,\" said\\r\\nPaul, \"because I shall always scotch the wheels with it.  I shall never\\r\\npinch my fingers again; my hands, you see, will be safe at the end of\\r\\nthis long stick; and, sister Anne, you need not be at the trouble of\\r\\ncarrying any more stones after me up the hill; we shall never want stones\\r\\nany more.  My scotcher will do without anything else, I hope.  I wish it\\r\\nwas morning, and that a carriage would come, that I might run up the\\r\\nhill, and try my scotcher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I wish that as many chaises may go by to-morrow as there did to-day,\\r\\nand that we may bring you as many halfpence, grandmother,\" said the\\r\\nlittle girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So do I, my dear Anne,\" said the old woman; \"for I mean that you and\\r\\nyour brother shall have all the money that you get to-morrow.  You may\\r\\nbuy some gingerbread for yourselves, or some of those ripe plums that you\\r\\nsaw at the fruit-stall the other day, which is just going into Dunstable.\\r\\nI told you then that I could not afford to buy such things for you; but\\r\\nnow that you can earn halfpence for yourselves, children, it is fair\\r\\nshould taste a ripe plum and bit of gingerbread for once and a way in\\r\\nyour lives.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ll bring some of the gingerbread home to her, shan\\'t we, brother?\"\\r\\nwhispered little Anne.  The morning came;  but no carriages were heard,\\r\\nthough Paul and his sister had risen at five o\\'clock, that they might be\\r\\nsure to be ready for early travellers.  Paul kept his scotcher poised\\r\\nupon his shoulder, and watched eagerly at his station at the bottom of\\r\\nthe hill.  He did not wait long before a carriage came.  He followed it\\r\\nup the hill; and the instant the postillion called to him, and bid him\\r\\nstop the wheels, he put his scotcher behind them, and found that it\\r\\nanswered the purpose perfectly well.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany carriages went by this day, and Paul and Anne received a great many\\r\\nhalfpence from the travellers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it grew dusk in the evening, Anne said to her brother--\"I don\\'t\\r\\nthink any more carriages will come by to-day.  Let us count the\\r\\nhalfpence, and carry them home now to grandmother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, not yet,\" answered Paul, \"let them alone--let them lie still in the\\r\\nhole where I have put them.  I daresay more carriages will come by before\\r\\nit is quite dark, and then we shall have more halfpence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul had taken the halfpence out of his hat, and he had put them into a\\r\\nhole in the high bank by the roadside; and Anne said she would not meddle\\r\\nwith them, and that she would wait till her brother liked to count them;\\r\\nand Paul said--\"If you will stay and watch here, I will go and gather\\r\\nsome blackberries for you in the hedge in yonder field.  Stand you\\r\\nhereabouts, half-way up the hill, and the moment you see any carriage\\r\\ncoming along the road, run as fast as you can and call me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne waited a long time, or what she thought a long time; and she saw no\\r\\ncarriage, and she trailed her brother\\'s scotcher up and down till she was\\r\\ntired.  Then she stood still, and looked again, and she saw no carriage;\\r\\nso she went sorrowfully into the field, and to the hedge where her\\r\\nbrother was gathering blackberries, and she said, \"Paul, I\\'m sadly tired,\\r\\nSADLY TIRED!\" said she, \"and my eyes are quite strained with looking for\\r\\nchaises; no more chaises will come to-night; and your scotcher is lying\\r\\nthere, of no use, upon the ground.  Have not I waited long enough for to-\\r\\nday, Paul?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" said Paul; \"here are some blackberries for you; you had better\\r\\nwait a little bit longer.  Perhaps a carriage might go by whilst you are\\r\\nstanding here talking to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne, who was of a very obliging temper, and who liked to do what she was\\r\\nasked to do, went back to the place where the scotcher lay; and scarcely\\r\\nhad she reached the spot, when she heard the noise of a carriage.  She\\r\\nran to call her brother, and to their great joy, they now saw four\\r\\nchaises coming towards them.  Paul, as soon as they went up the hill,\\r\\nfollowed with his scotcher; first he scotched the wheels of one carriage,\\r\\nthen of another; and Anne was so much delighted with observing how well\\r\\nthe scotcher stopped the wheels, and how much better it was than stones,\\r\\nthat she forgot to go and hold her brother\\'s hat to the travellers for\\r\\nhalfpence, till she was roused by the voice of a little rosy girl, who\\r\\nwas looking out of the window of one of the chaises.  \"Come close to the\\r\\nchaise-door,\" said the little girl; \"here are some halfpence for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne held the hat; and she afterwards went on to the other carriages.\\r\\nMoney was thrown to her from each of them; and when they had all gotten\\r\\nsafely to the top of the hill, she and her brother sat down upon a large\\r\\nstone by the roadside, to count their treasure.  First they began by\\r\\ncounting what was in the hat--\"One, two, three, four halfpence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, oh, brother, look at this!\" exclaimed Anne; \"this is not the same\\r\\nas the other halfpence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, it is not,\" cried Paul, \"it is no halfpenny; it is a guinea,\\r\\na bright golden guinea!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it?\" said Anne, who had never seen a guinea in her life before, and\\r\\nwho did not know its value; \"and will it do as well as a halfpenny to buy\\r\\ngingerbread?  I\\'ll run to the fruit-stall, and ask the woman; shall I?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" said Paul, \"you need not ask any woman, or anybody but me; I\\r\\ncan tell you all about it, as well as anybody in the whole world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The whole world!  Oh, Paul, you forgot.  Not so well as my grandmother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, not so well as my grandmother, perhaps, but, Anne, I can tell you\\r\\nthat you must not talk yourself, Anne, but you must listen to me quietly,\\r\\nor else you won\\'t understand what I am going to tell you, for I can\\r\\nassure you that I don\\'t think I quite understood it myself, Anne, the\\r\\nfirst time my grandmother told it to me, though I stood stock still\\r\\nlistening my best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPrepared by this speech to hear something very difficult to be\\r\\nunderstood, Anne looked very grave, and her brother explained to her,\\r\\nthat, with a guinea, she might buy two hundred and fifty-two times as\\r\\nmany plums as she could get for a penny.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Paul, you know the fruit-woman said she would give us a dozen plums\\r\\nfor a penny.  Now, for this little guinea, would she give us two hundred\\r\\nand fifty-two dozen?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If she has so many, and if we like to have so many, to be sure she\\r\\nwill,\" said Paul, \"but I think we should not like to have two hundred and\\r\\nfifty-two dozen of plums; we could not eat such a number.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But we could give some of them to my grandmother,\" said Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But still there would be too many for her, and for us, too,\" said Paul,\\r\\n\"and when we had eaten the plums, there would be an end to all the\\r\\npleasure.  But now I\\'ll tell you what I am thinking of, Anne, that we\\r\\nmight buy something for my grandmother, that would be very useful to her\\r\\nindeed, with the guinea--something that would last a great while.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, brother?  What sort of thing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something that she said she wanted very much last winter, when she was\\r\\nso ill with the rheumatism--something that she said yesterday, when you\\r\\nwere making her bed, she wished she might be able to buy before next\\r\\nwinter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know, I know what you mean!\" said Anne--\"a blanket.  Oh, yes, Paul,\\r\\nthat will be much better than plums; do let us buy a blanket for her; how\\r\\nglad she will be to see it!  I will make her bed with the new blanket,\\r\\nand then bring her to see it.  But, Paul, how shall we buy a blanket?\\r\\nWhere are blankets to be got?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leave that to me, I\\'ll manage that.  I know where blankets can be got.\\r\\nI saw one hanging out of a shop the day I went last to Dunstable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have seen a great many things at Dunstable, brother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, a great many; but I never saw anything there or anywhere else, that\\r\\nI wished for half so much as I did for the blanket for my grandmother.\\r\\nDo you remember how she used to shiver with the cold last winter?  I\\'ll\\r\\nbuy the blanket to-morrow.  I\\'m going to Dunstable with her spinning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you\\'ll bring the blanket to me, and I shall make the bed very\\r\\nneatly, that will be all right--all happy!\" said Anne, clapping her\\r\\nhands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But stay!  Hush! don\\'t clap your hands so, Anne; it will not be all\\r\\nhappy, I\\'m afraid,\" said Paul, and his countenance changed, and he looked\\r\\nvery grave.  \"It will not be all right, I\\'m afraid, for there is one\\r\\nthing we have neither of us thought of, but that we ought to think about.\\r\\nWe cannot buy the blanket, I\\'m afraid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, Paul, why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because I don\\'t think this guinea is honestly ours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, brother, but I\\'m sure it is honestly ours.  It was given to us, and\\r\\ngrandmother said all that was given to us to-day was to be our own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But who gave it to you, Anne?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some of the people in those chaises, Paul.  I don\\'t know which of them,\\r\\nbut I daresay it was the little rosy girl.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Paul, \"for when she called you to the chaise door, she said,\\r\\n\\'Here\\'s some halfpence for you.\\'  Now, if she gave you the guinea, she\\r\\nmust have given it to you by mistake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, but perhaps some of the people in the other chaises gave it to me,\\r\\nand did not give it to me by mistake, Paul.  There was a gentleman\\r\\nreading in one of the chaises and a lady, who looked very good-naturedly\\r\\nat me, and then the gentleman put down his book and put his head out of\\r\\nthe window, and looked at your scotcher, brother, and he asked me if that\\r\\nwas your own making; and when I said yes, and that I was your sister he\\r\\nsmiled at me, and put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and threw a\\r\\nhandful of halfpence into the hat, and I daresay he gave us the guinea\\r\\nalong with them because he liked your scotcher so much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" said Paul, \"that might be, to be sure, but I wish I was quite\\r\\ncertain of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, as we are not quite certain, had not we best go and ask my\\r\\ngrandmother what she thinks about it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul thought this was excellent advice; and he was not a silly boy, who\\r\\ndid not like to follow good advice.  He went with his sister directly to\\r\\nhis grandmother, showed her the guinea, and told her how they came by it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, honest children,\" said she, \"I am very glad you told me all\\r\\nthis.  I am very glad that you did not buy either the plums or the\\r\\nblanket with this guinea.  I\\'m sure it is not honestly ours.  Those who\\r\\nthrew it you gave it you by mistake, I warrant; and what I would have you\\r\\ndo is, to go to Dunstable, and try if you can, at either of the inns find\\r\\nout the person who gave it to you.  It is now so late in the evening that\\r\\nperhaps the travellers will sleep at Dunstable, instead of going on the\\r\\nnext stage; and it is likely that whosoever gave you a guinea instead of\\r\\na halfpenny has found out their mistake by this time.  All you can do is\\r\\nto go and inquire for the gentleman who was reading in the chaise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" interrupted Paul, \"I know a good way of finding him out.  I\\r\\nremember it was a dark green chaise with red wheels:  and I remember I\\r\\nread the innkeeper\\'s name upon the chaise, \\'John Nelson.\\'  (I am much\\r\\nobliged to you for teaching me to read, grandmother.)  You told me\\r\\nyesterday, grandmother, that the names written upon chaises are the\\r\\ninnkeepers to whom they belong.  I read the name of the innkeeper upon\\r\\nthat chaise.  It was John Nelson.  So Anne and I will go to both the inns\\r\\nin Dunstable, and try to find out this chaise--John Nelson\\'s.  Come,\\r\\nAnne; let us set out before it gets quite dark.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne and her brother passed with great courage the tempting stall that\\r\\nwas covered with gingerbread and ripe plums, and pursued their way\\r\\nsteadily through the streets of Dunstable; but Paul, when he came to the\\r\\nshop where he had seen the blanket, stopped for a moment, and said,  \"It\\r\\nis a great pity, Anne, that the guinea is not ours.  However, we are\\r\\ndoing what is honest, and that is a comfort.  Here, we must go through\\r\\nthis gateway, into the inn-yard; we are come to the \\'Dun Cow.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cow!\" said Anne, \"I see no cow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look up, and you\\'ll see the cow over your head,\" said Paul--\"the sign--\\r\\nthe picture.  Come, never mind looking at it now; I want to find out the\\r\\ngreen chaise that has John Nelson\\'s name upon it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul pushed forward, through a crowded passage, till he got into the inn-\\r\\nyard.  There was a great noise and bustle.  The hostlers were carrying in\\r\\nluggage.  The postillions were rubbing down the horses, or rolling the\\r\\nchaises into the coach-house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What now!  What business have you here, pray?\" said a waiter, who almost\\r\\nran over Paul, as he was crossing the yard in a great hurry to get some\\r\\nempty bottles from the bottle-rack.  \"You\\'ve no business here, crowding\\r\\nup the yard.  Walk off, young gentleman, if you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray give me leave, sir,\" said Paul, \"to stay a few minutes, to look\\r\\namongst these chaises for one dark green chaise with red wheels, that has\\r\\nMr. John Nelson\\'s name written upon it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that he says about a dark green chaise?\" said one of the\\r\\npostillions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What should such a one as he is know about chaises?\" interrupted the\\r\\nhasty waiter, and he vas going to turn Paul out of the yard; but the\\r\\nhostler caught hold of his arm and said, \"Maybe the child has some\\r\\nbusiness here; let\\'s know what he has to say for himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe waiter was at this instant luckily obliged to leave them to attend\\r\\nthe bell; and Paul told his business to the hostler, who as soon as he\\r\\nsaw the guinea and heard the story, shook Paul by the hand, and said,\\r\\n\"Stand steady, my honest lad; I\\'ll find the chaise for you, if it is to\\r\\nbe found here; but John Nelson\\'s chaises almost always drive to the\\r\\n\\'Black Bull.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some difficulty, the green chaise, with John Nelson\\'s name upon it,\\r\\nand the postillion who drove that chaise, were found; and the postillion\\r\\ntold Paul that he was just going into the parlour to the gentleman he had\\r\\ndriven, to be paid, and that he would carry the guinea with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Paul, \"we should like to give it back ourselves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said the hostler; \"that they have a right to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe postillion made no reply, but looked vexed, and went towards the\\r\\nhouse, desiring the children would wait in the passage till his return.\\r\\nIn the passage there was standing a decent, clean, good natured looking\\r\\nwoman, with two huge straw baskets on each side of her.  One of the\\r\\nbaskets stood a little in the way of the entrance.  A man who was pushing\\r\\nhis way in, and carried in his hand a string of dead larks hung to a\\r\\npole, impatient at being stopped, kicked down the straw basket, and all\\r\\nits contents were thrown out.  Bright straw hats, and boxes, and\\r\\nslippers, were all thrown in disorder upon the dirty ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, they will be trampled upon!  They will be all spoiled!\" exclaimed\\r\\nthe woman to whom they belonged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ll help you to pick them up if you will let us,\" cried Paul and Anne;\\r\\nand they immediately ran to her assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the things were all safe in the basket again, the children expressed\\r\\na desire to know how such beautiful things could be made of straw; but\\r\\nthe woman had not time to answer before the postillion came out of the\\r\\nparlour, and with him a gentleman\\'s servant, who came to Paul, and\\r\\nclapping him upon the back, said, \"So, my little chap, I gave you a\\r\\nguinea for a halfpenny, I hear; and I understand you\\'ve brought it back\\r\\nagain; that\\'s right, give me hold of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, brother,\" said Anne, \"this is not the gentleman that was reading.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pooh, child, I came in Mr. Nelson\\'s green chaise.  Here\\'s the postillion\\r\\ncan tell you so.  I and my master came in that chaise.  I and my master\\r\\nthat was reading, as you say, and it was he that threw the money out to\\r\\nyou.  He is going to bed; he is tired and can\\'t see you himself.  He\\r\\ndesires that you\\'ll give me the guinea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pushed them towards the door; but the basket-woman whispered to them\\r\\nas they went out, \"Wait in the street till I come to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, Mrs. Landlady,\" cried this gentleman\\'s servant, addressing himself\\r\\nto the landlady, who just then came out of a room where some company were\\r\\nat supper, \"Pray, Mrs. Landlady, please to let me have roasted larks for\\r\\nmy supper.  You are famous for larks at Dunstable; and I make it a rule\\r\\nto taste the best of everything wherever I go; and, waiter, let me have a\\r\\nbottle of claret.  Do you hear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Larks and claret for his supper,\" said the basket-woman to herself, as\\r\\nshe looked at him from head to foot.  The postillion was still waiting,\\r\\nas if to speak to him; and she observed them afterwards whispering and\\r\\nlaughing together.  \"NO BAD HIT,\" was a sentence which the servant\\r\\npronounced several times.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it occurred to the basket-woman that this man had cheated the\\r\\nchildren out of the guinea to pay for the larks and claret; and she\\r\\nthought that perhaps she could discover the truth.  She waited quietly in\\r\\nthe passage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Waiter! Joe! Joe!\" cried the landlady, \"why don\\'t you carry in the\\r\\nsweetmeat-puffs and the tarts here to the company in the best parlour?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Coming, ma\\'am,\" answered the waiter; and with a large dish of tarts and\\r\\npuffs, the waiter came from the bar; the landlady threw open the door of\\r\\nthe best parlour, to let him in; and the basket-woman had now a full view\\r\\nof a large cheerful company, and amongst them several children, sitting\\r\\nround a supper-table.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay,\" whispered the landlady, as the door closed after the waiter and the\\r\\ntarts, \"there are customers enough, I warrant, for you in that room, if\\r\\nyou had but the luck to be called in.  Pray, what would you have the\\r\\nconscience, I wonder now, to charge me for these here half-dozen little\\r\\nmats to put under my dishes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A trifle, ma\\'am,\" said the basket-woman.  She let the landlady have the\\r\\nmats cheap, and the landlady then declared she would step in and see if\\r\\nthe company in the best parlour had done supper.  \"When they come to\\r\\ntheir wine,\" added she, \"I\\'ll speak a good word for you, and get you\\r\\ncalled in afore the children are sent to bed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe landlady, after the usual speech of, \"I hope the supper and\\r\\neverything is to your liking, ladies and gentlemen,\" began with, \"If any\\r\\nof the young gentlemen or ladies would have a CUR\\'OSITY to see any of our\\r\\nfamous Dunstable straw-work, there\\'s a decent body without would, I\\r\\ndaresay, be proud to show them her pincushion-boxes, and her baskets and\\r\\nslippers, and her other CUR\\'OSITIES.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eyes of the children all turned towards their mother; their mother\\r\\nsmiled, and immediately their father called in the basket-woman, and\\r\\ndesired her to produce her CURIOSITIES.  The children gathered round her\\r\\nlarge pannier as it opened, but they did not touch any of her things.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, papa!\" cried a little rosy girl, \"here are a pair of straw slippers\\r\\nthat would just fit you, I think; but would not straw shoes wear out very\\r\\nsoon? and would not they let in the wet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, my dear,\" said her father, \"but these slippers are meant--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For powdering-slippers, miss,\" interrupted the basket-woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To wear when people are powdering their hair,\" continued the gentleman,\\r\\n\"that they may not spoil their other shoes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And will you buy them, papa?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I cannot indulge myself,\" said her father, \"in buying them now.  I\\r\\nmust make amends,\" said he, laughing, \"for my carelessness; and as I\\r\\nthrew away a guinea to-day, I must endeavour to save sixpence at least?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, the guinea that you threw by mistake into the little girl\\'s hat as\\r\\nwe were coming up Chalk Hill.  Mamma, I wonder that the little girl did\\r\\nnot take notice of its being a guinea, and that she did not run after the\\r\\nchaise to give it back again.  I should think, if she had been an honest\\r\\ngirl, she would have returned it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss!--ma\\'am!--sir!\" said the basket-woman, \"if it would not be\\r\\nimpertinent, may I speak a word?  A little boy and girl have just been\\r\\nhere inquiring for a gentleman who gave them a guinea instead of a\\r\\nhalfpenny by mistake; and not five minutes ago I saw the boy give the\\r\\nguinea to a gentleman\\'s servant, who is there without, and who said his\\r\\nmaster desired it should be returned to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There must be some mistake, or some trick in this,\" said the gentleman.\\r\\n\"Are the children gone?  I must see them--send after them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll go for them myself,\" said the good natured basket-woman; \"I bid\\r\\nthem wait in the street yonder, for my mind misgave me that the man who\\r\\nspoke so short to them was a cheat, with his larks and his claret.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul and Anne were speedily summoned, and brought back by their friend\\r\\nthe basket-woman; and Anne, the moment she saw the gentleman, knew that\\r\\nhe was the very person who smiled upon her, who admired her brother\\'s\\r\\nscotcher, and who threw a handful of halfpence into the hat; but she\\r\\ncould not be certain, she said, that she received the guinea from him;\\r\\nshe only thought it most likely that she did.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I can be certain whether the guinea you returned be mine or no,\"\\r\\nsaid the gentleman.  \"I marked the guinea; it was a light one; the only\\r\\nguinea I had, which I put into my waistcoat pocket this morning.\"  He\\r\\nrang the bell, and desired the waiter to let the gentleman who was in the\\r\\nroom opposite to him know that he wished to see him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The gentleman in the white parlour, sir, do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean the master of the servant who received a guinea from this child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is a Mr. Pembroke, sir,\" said the waiter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pembroke came; and as soon as he heard what had happened, he desired\\r\\nthe waiter to show him to the room where his servant was at supper.  The\\r\\ndishonest servant, who was supping upon larks and claret, knew nothing of\\r\\nwhat was going on; but his knife and fork dropped from his hand, and he\\r\\noverturned a bumper of claret as he started up from the table, in great\\r\\nsurprise and terror, when his master came in with a face of indignation,\\r\\nand demanded \"THE GUINEA--the GUINEA, sir! that you got from this child;\\r\\nthat guinea which you said I ordered you to ask for from this child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant, confounded and half intoxicated, could only stammer out that\\r\\nhe had more guineas than one about him, and that he really did not know\\r\\nwhich it was.  He pulled his money out, and spread it upon the table with\\r\\ntrembling hands.  The marked guinea appeared.  His master instantly\\r\\nturned him out of his service with strong expressions of contempt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now, my little honest girl,\" said the gentleman who had admired her\\r\\nbrother\\'s scotcher, turning to Anne, \"and now tell me who you are, and\\r\\nwhat you and your brother want or wish for most in the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the same moment Anne and Paul exclaimed, \"The thing we wish for the\\r\\nmost in the world is a blanket for our grandmother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is not our grandmother in reality, I believe, sir,\" said Paul; \"but\\r\\nshe is just as good to us, and taught me to read, and taught Anne to\\r\\nknit, and taught us both that we should be honest--so she has; and I wish\\r\\nshe had a new blanket before next winter, to keep her from the cold and\\r\\nthe rheumatism.  She had the rheumatism sadly last winter, sir; and there\\r\\nis a blanket in this street that would be just the thing for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She shall have it, then; and,\" continued the gentleman, \"I will do\\r\\nsomething more for you.  Do you like to be employed or to be idle best?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We like to have something to do always, if we could, sir,\" said Paul;\\r\\n\"but we are forced to be idle sometimes, because grandmother has not\\r\\nalways things for us to do that we CAN do well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Should you like to learn how to make such baskets as these?\" said the\\r\\ngentleman, pointing to one of the Dunstable straw-baskets.  \"Oh, very\\r\\nmuch!\" said Paul.  \"Very much!\" said Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I should like to teach you how to make them,\" said the basket-\\r\\nwoman; \"for I\\'m sure of one thing, that you\\'d behave honestly to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentleman put a guinea into the good natured basket-woman\\'s hand, and\\r\\ntold her that he knew she could not afford to teach them her trade for\\r\\nnothing.  \"I shall come through Dunstable again in a few months,\" added\\r\\nhe; \"and I hope to see that you and your scholars are going on well.  If\\r\\nI find that they are, I will do something more for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" said Anne, \"we must tell all this to grandmother, and ask her\\r\\nabout it; and I\\'m afraid--though I\\'m very happy--that it is getting very\\r\\nlate, and that we should not stay here any longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a fine moonlight night,\" said the basket-woman; \"and is not far.\\r\\nI\\'ll walk with you, and see you safe home myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentleman detained them a few minutes longer, till a messenger whom\\r\\nhe had dispatched to purchase the much wished for blanket returned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your grandmother will sleep well upon this good blanket, I hope,\" said\\r\\nthe gentleman, as he gave it into Paul\\'s opened arms.  \"It has been\\r\\nobtained for her by the honesty of her adopted children.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

Thus twice before, and iust at this dead houre,\\nWith Martiall stalke, hath he gone by our Watch\\n\\n   Hor. In what particular thought to work, I know not:\\nBut in the grosse and scope of my Opinion,\\nThis boades some strange erruption to our State\\n\\n   Mar. Good now sit downe, & tell me he that knowes\\nWhy this same strict and most obseruant Watch,\\nSo nightly toyles the subiect of the Land,\\nAnd why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon\\nAnd Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre:\\nWhy such impresse of Ship-wrights, whose sore Taske\\nDo's not diuide the Sunday from the weeke,\\nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty hast\\nDoth make the Night ioynt-Labourer with the day:\\nWho is't that can informe me?\\n  Hor. That can I,\\nAt least the whisper goes so: Our last King,\\nWhose Image euen but now appear'd to vs,\\nWas (as you know) by Fortinbras of Norway,\\n(Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate Pride)\\nDar'd to the Combate. In which, our Valiant Hamlet,\\n(For so this side of our knowne world esteem'd him)\\nDid slay this Fortinbras: who by a Seal'd Compact,\\nWell ratified by Law, and Heraldrie,\\nDid forfeite (with his life) all those his Lands\\nWhich he stood seiz'd on, to the Conqueror:\\nAgainst the which, a Moity competent\\nWas gaged by our King: which had return'd\\nTo the Inheritance of Fortinbras,\\nHad he bin Vanquisher, as by the same Cou'nant\\nAnd carriage of the Article designe,\\nHis fell to Hamlet. Now sir, young Fortinbras,\\nOf vnimproued Mettle, hot and full,\\nHath in the skirts of Norway, heere and there,\\nShark'd vp a List of Landlesse Resolutes,\\nFor Foode and Diet, to some Enterprize\\nThat hath a stomacke in't: which is no other\\n(And it doth well appeare vnto our State)\\nBut to recouer of vs by strong hand\\nAnd termes Compulsatiue, those foresaid Lands\\nSo by his Father lost: and this (I take it)\\nIs the maine Motiue of our Preparations,\\nThe Sourse of this our Watch, and the cheefe head\\nOf this post-hast, and Romage in the Land.\\nEnter Ghost againe.\\n\\nBut soft, behold: Loe, where it comes againe:\\nIle crosse it, though it blast me. Stay Illusion:\\nIf thou hast any sound, or vse of Voyce,\\nSpeake to me. If there be any good thing to be done,\\nThat may to thee do ease, and grace to me; speak to me.\\nIf thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate\\n(Which happily foreknowing may auoyd) Oh speake.\\nOr, if thou hast vp-hoorded in thy life\\nExtorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth,\\n(For which, they say, you Spirits oft walke in death)\\nSpeake of it. Stay, and speake. Stop it Marcellus\\n\\n   Mar. Shall I strike at it with my Partizan?\\n  Hor. Do, if it will not stand\\n\\n   Barn. 'Tis heere\\n\\n   Hor. 'Tis heere\\n\\n   Mar. 'Tis gone.\\n\\nExit Ghost.\\n\\nWe do it wrong, being so Maiesticall\\nTo offer it the shew of Violence,\\nFor it is as the Ayre, invulnerable,\\nAnd our vaine blowes, malicious Mockery\\n\\n   Barn. It was about to speake, when the Cocke crew\\n\\n   Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing\\nVpon a fearfull Summons. I haue heard,\\nThe Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day,\\nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding Throate\\nAwake the God of Day: and at his warning,\\nWhether in Sea, or Fire, in Earth, or Ayre,\\nTh' extrauagant, and erring Spirit, hyes\\nTo his Confine. And of the truth heerein,\\nThis present Obiect made probation\\n\\n   Mar. It faded on the crowing of the Cocke.\\nSome sayes, that euer 'gainst that Season comes\\nWherein our Sauiours Birch is celebrated,\\nThe Bird of Dawning singeth all night long:\\nAnd then (they say) no Spirit can walke abroad,\\nThe nights are wholsome, then no Planets strike,\\nNo Faiery talkes, nor Witch hath power to Charme:\\nSo hallow'd, and so gracious is the time\\n\\n   Hor. So haue I heard, and do in part beleeue it.\\nBut looke, the Morne in Russet mantle clad,\\nWalkes o're the dew of yon high Easterne Hill,\\nBreake we our Watch vp, and by my aduice\\nLet vs impart what we haue seene to night\\nVnto yong Hamlet. For vpon my life,\\nThis Spirit dumbe to vs, will speake to him:\\nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\\nAs needfull in our Loues, fitting our Duty?\\n  Mar. Let do't I pray, and I this morning know\\nWhere we shall finde him most conueniently.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nScena Secunda.\\n\\nEnter Claudius King of Denmarke, Gertrude the Queene, Hamlet,\\nPolonius,\\nLaertes, and his Sister Ophelia, Lords Attendant.\\n\\n  King. Though yet of Hamlet our deere Brothers death\\nThe memory be greene: and that it vs befitted\\nTo beare our hearts in greefe, and our whole Kingdome\\nTo be contracted in one brow of woe:\\nYet so farre hath Discretion fought with Nature,\\nThat we with wisest sorrow thinke on him,\\nTogether with remembrance of our selues.\\nTherefore our sometimes Sister, now our Queene,\\nTh' imperiall Ioyntresse of this warlike State,\\nHaue we, as 'twere, with a defeated ioy,\\nWith one Auspicious, and one Dropping eye,\\nWith mirth in Funerall, and with Dirge in Marriage,\\nIn equall Scale weighing Delight and Dole\\nTaken to Wife; nor haue we heerein barr'd\\nYour better Wisedomes, which haue freely gone\\nWith this affaire along, for all our Thankes.\\nNow followes, that you know young Fortinbras,\\nHolding a weake supposall of our worth;\\nOr thinking by our late deere Brothers death,\\nOur State to be disioynt, and out of Frame,\\nColleagued with the dreame of his Aduantage;\\nHe hath not fayl'd to pester vs with Message,\\nImporting the surrender of those Lands\\nLost by his Father: with all Bonds of Law\\nTo our most valiant Brother. So much for him.\\nEnter Voltemand and Cornelius.\\n\\nNow for our selfe, and for this time of meeting\\nThus much the businesse is. We haue heere writ\\nTo Norway, Vncle of young Fortinbras,\\nWho Impotent and Bedrid, scarsely heares\\nOf this his Nephewes purpose, to suppresse\\nHis further gate heerein. In that the Leuies,\\nThe Lists, and full proportions are all made\\nOut of his subiect: and we heere dispatch\\nYou good Cornelius, and you Voltemand,\\nFor bearing of this greeting to old Norway,\\nGiuing to you no further personall power\\nTo businesse with the King, more then the scope\\nOf these dilated Articles allow:\\nFarewell, and let your hast commend your duty\\n\\n   Volt. In that, and all things, will we shew our duty\\n\\n   King. We doubt it nothing, heartily farewell.\\n\\nExit Voltemand and Cornelius.\\n\\nAnd now Laertes, what's the newes with you?\\nYou told vs of some suite. What is't Laertes?\\nYou cannot speake of Reason to the Dane,\\nAnd loose your voyce. What would'st thou beg Laertes,\\nThat shall not be my Offer, not thy Asking?\\nThe Head is not more Natiue to the Heart,\\nThe Hand more instrumentall to the Mouth,\\nThen is the Throne of Denmarke to thy Father.\\nWhat would'st thou haue Laertes?\\n  Laer. Dread my Lord,\\nYour leaue and fauour to returne to France,\\nFrom whence, though willingly I came to Denmarke\\nTo shew my duty in your Coronation,\\nYet now I must confesse, that duty done,\\nMy thoughts and wishes bend againe towards France,\\nAnd bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon\\n\\n   King. Haue you your Fathers leaue?\\nWhat sayes Pollonius?\\n  Pol. He hath my Lord:\\nI do beseech you giue him leaue to go\\n\\n   King. Take thy faire houre Laertes, time be thine,\\nAnd thy best graces spend it at thy will:\\nBut now my Cosin Hamlet, and my Sonne?\\n  Ham. A little more then kin, and lesse then kinde\\n\\n   King. How is it that the Clouds still hang on you?\\n  Ham. Not so my Lord, I am too much i'th' Sun\\n\\n   Queen. Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off,\\nAnd let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke.\\nDo not for euer with thy veyled lids\\nSeeke for thy Noble Father in the dust;\\nThou know'st 'tis common, all that liues must dye,\\nPassing through Nature, to Eternity\\n\\n   Ham. I Madam, it is common\\n\\n   Queen. If it be;\\nWhy seemes it so particular with thee\\n\\n   Ham. Seemes Madam? Nay, it is: I know not Seemes:\\n'Tis not alone my Inky Cloake (good Mother)\\nNor Customary suites of solemne Blacke,\\nNor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,\\nNo, nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye,\\nNor the deiected hauiour of the Visage,\\nTogether with all Formes, Moods, shewes of Griefe,\\nThat can denote me truly. These indeed Seeme,\\nFor they are actions that a man might play:\\nBut I haue that Within, which passeth show;\\nThese, but the Trappings, and the Suites of woe\\n\\n   King. 'Tis sweet and commendable\\nIn your Nature Hamlet,\\nTo giue these mourning duties to your Father:\\nBut you must know, your Father lost a Father,\\nThat Father lost, lost his, and the Suruiuer bound\\nIn filiall Obligation, for some terme\\nTo do obsequious Sorrow. But to perseuer\\nIn obstinate Condolement, is a course\\nOf impious stubbornnesse. 'Tis vnmanly greefe,\\nIt shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen,\\nA Heart vnfortified, a Minde impatient,\\nAn Vnderstanding simple, and vnschool'd:\\nFor, what we know must be, and is as common\\nAs any the most vulgar thing to sence,\\nWhy should we in our peeuish Opposition\\nTake it to heart? Fye, 'tis a fault to Heauen,\\nA fault against the Dead, a fault to Nature,\\nTo Reason most absurd, whose common Theame\\nIs death of Fathers, and who still hath cried,\\nFrom the first Coarse, till he that dyed to day,\\nThis must be so. We pray you throw to earth\\nThis vnpreuayling woe, and thinke of vs\\nAs of a Father; For let the world take note,\\nYou are the most immediate to our Throne,\\nAnd with no lesse Nobility of Loue,\\nThen that which deerest Father beares his Sonne,\\nDo I impart towards you. For your intent\\nIn going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg,\\nIt is most retrograde to our desire:\\nAnd we beseech you, bend you to remaine\\nHeere in the cheere and comfort of our eye,\\nOur cheefest Courtier Cosin, and our Sonne\\n\\n   Qu. Let not thy Mother lose her Prayers Hamlet:\\nI prythee stay with vs, go not to Wittenberg\\n\\n   Ham. I shall in all my best\\nObey you Madam\\n\\n   King. Why 'tis a louing, and a faire Reply,\\nBe as our selfe in Denmarke. Madam come,\\nThis gentle and vnforc'd accord of Hamlet\\nSits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,\\nNo iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day,\\nBut the great Cannon to the Clowds shall tell,\\nAnd the Kings Rouce, the Heauens shall bruite againe,\\nRespeaking earthly Thunder. Come away.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nManet Hamlet.\\n\\n  Ham. Oh that this too too solid Flesh, would melt,\\nThaw, and resolue it selfe into a Dew:\\nOr that the Euerlasting had not fixt\\nHis Cannon 'gainst Selfe-slaughter. O God, O God!\\nHow weary, stale, flat, and vnprofitable\\nSeemes to me all the vses of this world?\\nFie on't? Oh fie, fie, 'tis an vnweeded Garden\\nThat growes to Seed: Things rank, and grosse in Nature\\nPossesse it meerely. That it should come to this:\\nBut two months dead: Nay, not so much; not two,\\nSo excellent a King, that was to this\\nHiperion to a Satyre: so louing to my Mother,\\nThat he might not beteene the windes of heauen\\nVisit her face too roughly. Heauen and Earth\\nMust I remember: why she would hang on him,\\nAs if encrease of Appetite had growne\\nBy what is fed on; and yet within a month?\\nLet me not thinke on't: Frailty, thy name is woman.\\nA little Month, or ere those shooes were old,\\nWith which she followed my poore Fathers body\\nLike Niobe, all teares. Why she, euen she.\\n(O Heauen! A beast that wants discourse of Reason\\nWould haue mourn'd longer) married with mine Vnkle,\\nMy Fathers Brother: but no more like my Father,\\nThen I to Hercules. Within a Moneth?\\nEre yet the salt of most vnrighteous Teares\\nHad left the flushing of her gauled eyes,\\nShe married. O most wicked speed, to post\\nWith such dexterity to Incestuous sheets:\\nIt is not, nor it cannot come to good.\\nBut breake my heart, for I must hold my tongue.\\nEnter Horatio, Barnardo, and Marcellus.\\n\\n  Hor. Haile to your Lordship\\n\\n   Ham. I am glad to see you well:\\nHoratio, or I do forget my selfe\\n\\n   Hor. The same my Lord,\\nAnd your poore Seruant euer\\n\\n   Ham. Sir my good friend,\\nIle change that name with you:\\nAnd what make you from Wittenberg Horatio?\\nMarcellus\\n\\n   Mar. My good Lord\\n\\n   Ham. I am very glad to see you: good euen Sir.\\nBut what in faith make you from Wittemberge?\\n  Hor. A truant disposition, good my Lord\\n\\n   Ham. I would not haue your Enemy say so;\\nNor shall you doe mine eare that violence,\\nTo make it truster of your owne report\\nAgainst your selfe. I know you are no Truant:\\nBut what is your affaire in Elsenour?\\nWee'l teach you to drinke deepe, ere you depart\\n\\n   Hor. My Lord, I came to see your Fathers Funerall\\n\\n   Ham. I pray thee doe not mock me (fellow Student)\\nI thinke it was to see my Mothers Wedding\\n\\n   Hor. Indeed my Lord, it followed hard vpon\\n\\n   Ham. Thrift thrift Horatio: the Funerall Bakt-meats\\nDid coldly furnish forth the Marriage Tables;\\nWould I had met my dearest foe in heauen,\\nEre I had euer seene that day Horatio.\\nMy father, me thinkes I see my father\\n\\n   Hor. Oh where my Lord?\\n  Ham. In my minds eye (Horatio)\\n  Hor. I saw him once; he was a goodly King\\n\\n   Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all:\\nI shall not look vpon his like againe\\n\\n   Hor. My Lord, I thinke I saw him yesternight\\n\\n   Ham. Saw? Who?\\n  Hor. My Lord, the King your Father\\n\\n   Ham. The King my Father?\\n  Hor. Season your admiration for a while\\nWith an attent eare; till I may deliuer\\nVpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen,\\nThis maruell to you\\n\\n   Ham. For Heauens loue let me heare\\n\\n   Hor. Two nights together, had these Gentlemen\\n(Marcellus and Barnardo) on their Watch\\nIn the dead wast and middle of the night\\nBeene thus encountred. A figure like your Father,\\nArm'd at all points exactly, Cap a Pe,\\nAppeares before them, and with sollemne march\\nGoes slow and stately: By them thrice he walkt,\\nBy their opprest and feare-surprized eyes,\\nWithin his Truncheons length; whilst they bestil'd\\nAlmost to Ielly with the Act of feare,\\nStand dumbe and speake not to him. This to me\\nIn dreadfull secrecie impart they did,\\nAnd I with them the third Night kept the Watch,\\nWhereas they had deliuer'd both in time,\\nForme of the thing; each word made true and good,\\nThe Apparition comes. I knew your Father:\\nThese hands are not more like\\n\\n   Ham. But where was this?\\n  Mar. My Lord vpon the platforme where we watcht\\n\\n   Ham. Did you not speake to it?\\n  Hor. My Lord, I did;\\nBut answere made it none: yet once me thought\\nIt lifted vp it head, and did addresse\\nIt selfe to motion, like as it would speake:\\nBut euen then, the Morning Cocke crew lowd;\\nAnd at the sound it shrunke in hast away,\\nAnd vanisht from our sight\\n\\n   Ham. Tis very strange\\n\\n   Hor. As I doe liue my honourd Lord 'tis true;\\nAnd we did thinke it writ downe in our duty\\nTo let you know of it\\n\\n   Ham. Indeed, indeed Sirs; but this troubles me.\\nHold you the watch to Night?\\n  Both. We doe my Lord\\n\\n   Ham. Arm'd, say you?\\n  Both. Arm'd, my Lord\\n\\n   Ham. From top to toe?\\n  Both. My Lord, from head to foote\\n\\n   Ham. Then saw you not his face?\\n  Hor. O yes, my Lord, he wore his Beauer vp\\n\\n   Ham. What, lookt he frowningly?\\n  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow then in anger\\n\\n   Ham. Pale, or red?\\n  Hor. Nay very pale\\n\\n   Ham. And fixt his eyes vpon you?\\n  Hor. Most constantly\\n\\n   Ham. I would I had beene there\\n\\n   Hor. It would haue much amaz'd you\\n\\n   Ham. Very like, very like: staid it long?\\n  Hor. While one with moderate hast might tell a hundred\\n\\n   All. Longer, longer\\n\\n   Hor. Not when I saw't\\n\\n   Ham. His Beard was grisly? no\\n\\n   Hor. It was, as I haue seene it in his life,\\nA Sable Siluer'd\\n\\n   Ham. Ile watch to Night; perchance 'twill wake againe\\n\\n   Hor. I warrant you it will\\n\\n   Ham. If it assume my noble Fathers person,\\nIle speake to it, though Hell it selfe should gape\\nAnd bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,\\nIf you haue hitherto conceald this sight;\\nLet it bee treble in your silence still:\\nAnd whatsoeuer els shall hap to night,\\nGiue it an vnderstanding but no tongue;\\nI will requite your loues; so fare ye well:\\nVpon the Platforme twixt eleuen and twelue,\\nIle visit you\\n\\n   All.

Thinke it no more:\\nFor nature cressant does not grow alone,\\nIn thewes and Bulke: but as his Temple waxes,\\nThe inward seruice of the Minde and Soule\\nGrowes wide withall. Perhaps he loues you now,\\nAnd now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch\\nThe vertue of his feare: but you must feare\\nHis greatnesse weigh'd, his will is not his owne;\\nFor hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth:\\nHee may not, as vnuallued persons doe,\\nCarue for himselfe; for, on his choyce depends\\nThe sanctity and health of the whole State.\\nAnd therefore must his choyce be circumscrib'd\\nVnto the voyce and yeelding of that Body,\\nWhereof he is the Head. Then if he sayes he loues you,\\nIt fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it;\\nAs he in his peculiar Sect and force\\nMay giue his saying deed: which is no further,\\nThen the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall.\\nThen weight what losse your Honour may sustaine,\\nIf with too credent eare you list his Songs;\\nOr lose your Heart; or your chast Treasure open\\nTo his vnmastred importunity.\\nFeare it Ophelia, feare it my deare Sister,\\nAnd keepe within the reare of your Affection;\\nOut of the shot and danger of Desire.\\nThe chariest Maid is Prodigall enough,\\nIf she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone:\\nVertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes,\\nThe Canker Galls, the Infants of the Spring\\nToo oft before the buttons be disclos'd,\\nAnd in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth,\\nContagious blastments are most imminent.\\nBe wary then, best safety lies in feare;\\nYouth to it selfe rebels, though none else neere\\n\\n   Ophe.

So please you, somthing touching the L[ord]. Hamlet\\n\\n   Polon. Marry, well bethought:\\nTis told me he hath very oft of late\\nGiuen priuate time to you; and you your selfe\\nHaue of your audience beene most free and bounteous.\\nIf it be so, as so tis put on me;\\nAnd that in way of caution: I must tell you,\\nYou doe not vnderstand your selfe so cleerely,\\nAs it behoues my Daughter, and your Honour.\\nWhat is betweene you, giue me vp the truth?\\n  Ophe. He hath my Lord of late, made many tenders\\nOf his affection to me\\n\\n   Polon. Affection, puh. You speake like a greene Girle,\\nVnsifted in such perillous Circumstance.\\nDoe you beleeue his tenders, as you call them?\\n  Ophe. I do not know, my Lord, what I should thinke\\n\\n   Polon. Marry Ile teach you; thinke your selfe a Baby,\\nThat you haue tane his tenders for true pay,\\nWhich are not starling. Tender your selfe more dearly;\\nOr not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase,\\nRoaming it thus, you'l tender me a foole\\n\\n   Ophe. My Lord, he hath importun'd me with loue,\\nIn honourable fashion\\n\\n   Polon. I, fashion you may call it, go too, go too\\n\\n   Ophe. And hath giuen countenance to his speech,\\nMy Lord, with all the vowes of Heauen\\n\\n   Polon. I, Springes to catch Woodcocks. I doe know\\nWhen the Bloud burnes, how Prodigall the Soule\\nGiues the tongue vowes: these blazes, Daughter,\\nGiuing more light then heate; extinct in both,\\nEuen in their promise, as it is a making;\\nYou must not take for fire. For this time Daughter,\\nBe somewhat scanter of your Maiden presence;\\nSet your entreatments at a higher rate,\\nThen a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,\\nBeleeue so much in him, that he is young,\\nAnd with a larger tether may he walke,\\nThen may be giuen you. In few, Ophelia,\\nDoe not beleeue his vowes; for they are Broakers,\\nNot of the eye, which their Inuestments show:\\nBut meere implorators of vnholy Sutes,\\nBreathing like sanctified and pious bonds,\\nThe better to beguile. This is for all:\\nI would not, in plaine tearmes, from this time forth,\\nHaue you so slander any moment leisure,\\nAs to giue words or talke with the Lord Hamlet:\\nLooke too't, I charge you; come your wayes\\n\\n   Ophe. I shall obey my Lord.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nEnter Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus.\\n\\n  Ham. The Ayre bites shrewdly: is it very cold?\\n  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager ayre\\n\\n   Ham.

Indeed I heard it not: then it drawes neere the season,\\nWherein the Spirit held his wont to walke.\\nWhat does this meane my Lord?\\n  Ham. The King doth wake to night, and takes his rouse,\\nKeepes wassels and the swaggering vpspring reeles,\\nAnd as he dreines his draughts of Renish downe,\\nThe kettle Drum and Trumpet thus bray out\\nThe triumph of his Pledge\\n\\n   Horat.

What if it tempt you toward the Floud my Lord?\\nOr to the dreadfull Sonnet of the Cliffe,\\nThat beetles o're his base into the Sea,\\nAnd there assumes some other horrible forme,\\nWhich might depriue your Soueraignty of Reason,\\nAnd draw you into madnesse thinke of it?\\n  Ham. It wafts me still: goe on, Ile follow thee\\n\\n   Mar. You shall not goe my Lord\\n\\n   Ham. Hold off your hand\\n\\n   Hor. Be rul'd, you shall not goe\\n\\n   Ham.

Mad for thy Loue?\\n  Ophe. My Lord, I doe not know: but truly I do feare it\\n\\n   Polon. What said he?\\n  Ophe. He tooke me by the wrist, and held me hard;\\nThen goes he to the length of all his arme;\\nAnd with his other hand thus o're his brow,\\nHe fals to such perusall of my face,\\nAs he would draw it. Long staid he so,\\nAt last, a little shaking of mine Arme:\\nAnd thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe;\\nHe rais'd a sigh, so pittious and profound,\\nThat it did seeme to shatter all his bulke,\\nAnd end his being. That done, he lets me goe,\\nAnd with his head ouer his shoulders turn'd,\\nHe seem'd to finde his way without his eyes,\\nFor out adores he went without their helpe;\\nAnd to the last, bended their light on me\\n\\n   Polon. Goe with me, I will goe seeke the King,\\nThis is the very extasie of Loue,\\nWhose violent property foredoes it selfe,\\nAnd leads the will to desperate Vndertakings,\\nAs oft as any passion vnder Heauen,\\nThat does afflict our Natures. I am sorrie,\\nWhat haue you giuen him any hard words of late?\\n  Ophe. No my good Lord: but as you did command,\\nI did repell his Letters, and deny'de\\nHis accesse to me\\n\\n   Pol. That hath made him mad.\\nI am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement\\nI had not quoted him. I feare he did but trifle,\\nAnd meant to wracke thee: but beshrew my iealousie:\\nIt seemes it is as proper to our Age,\\nTo cast beyond our selues in our Opinions,\\nAs it is common for the yonger sort\\nTo lacke discretion.

Then you liue about her waste, or in the middle\\nof her fauour?\\n  Guil. Faith, her priuates, we\\n\\n   Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? Oh, most true:\\nshe is a Strumpet. What's the newes?\\n  Rosin. None my Lord; but that the World's growne\\nhonest\\n\\n   Ham. Then is Doomesday neere: But your newes is\\nnot true. Let me question more in particular: what haue\\nyou my good friends, deserued at the hands of Fortune,\\nthat she sends you to Prison hither?\\n  Guil. Prison, my Lord?\\n  Ham. Denmark's a Prison\\n\\n   Rosin. Then is the World one\\n\\n   Ham. A goodly one, in which there are many Confines,\\nWards, and Dungeons; Denmarke being one o'th'\\nworst\\n\\n   Rosin. We thinke not so my Lord\\n\\n   Ham. Why then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing\\neither good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is\\na prison\\n\\n   Rosin. Why then your Ambition makes it one: 'tis\\ntoo narrow for your minde\\n\\n   Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and\\ncount my selfe a King of infinite space; were it not that\\nI haue bad dreames\\n\\n   Guil. Which dreames indeed are Ambition: for the\\nvery substance of the Ambitious, is meerely the shadow\\nof a Dreame\\n\\n   Ham. A dreame it selfe is but a shadow\\n\\n   Rosin. Truely, and I hold Ambition of so ayry and\\nlight a quality, that it is but a shadowes shadow\\n\\n   Ham. Then are our Beggers bodies; and our Monarchs\\nand out-stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes:\\nshall wee to th' Court: for, by my fey I cannot reason?\\n  Both. Wee'l wait vpon you\\n\\n   Ham. No such matter. I will not sort you with the\\nrest of my seruants: for to speake to you like an honest\\nman: I am most dreadfully attended; but in the beaten\\nway of friendship, What make you at Elsonower?\\n  Rosin. To visit you my Lord, no other occasion\\n\\n   Ham. Begger that I am, I am euen poore in thankes;\\nbut I thanke you: and sure deare friends my thanks\\nare too deare a halfepeny; were you not sent for? Is it\\nyour owne inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,\\ndeale iustly with me: come, come; nay speake\\n\\n   Guil. What should we say my Lord?\\n  Ham. Why any thing. But to the purpose; you were\\nsent for; and there is a kinde confession in your lookes;\\nwhich your modesties haue not craft enough to color,\\nI know the good King & Queene haue sent for you\\n\\n   Rosin. To what end my Lord?\\n  Ham. That you must teach me: but let mee coniure\\nyou by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of\\nour youth, by the Obligation of our euer-preserued loue,\\nand by what more deare, a better proposer could charge\\nyou withall; be euen and direct with me, whether you\\nwere sent for or no\\n\\n   Rosin. What say you?\\n  Ham. Nay then I haue an eye of you: if you loue me\\nhold not off\\n\\n   Guil. My Lord, we were sent for\\n\\n   Ham. I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation\\npreuent your discouery of your secricie to the King and\\nQueene: moult no feather, I haue of late, but wherefore\\nI know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custome of exercise;\\nand indeed, it goes so heauenly with my disposition;\\nthat this goodly frame the Earth, seemes to me a sterrill\\nPromontory; this most excellent Canopy the Ayre,\\nlook you, this braue ore-hanging, this Maiesticall Roofe,\\nfretted with golden fire: why, it appeares no other thing\\nto mee, then a foule and pestilent congregation of vapours.\\nWhat a piece of worke is a man! how Noble in\\nReason? how infinite in faculty? in forme and mouing\\nhow expresse and admirable? in Action, how like an Angel?\\nin apprehension, how like a God? the beauty of the\\nworld, the Parragon of Animals; and yet to me, what is\\nthis Quintessence of Dust? Man delights not me; no,\\nnor Woman neither; though by your smiling you seeme\\nto say so\\n\\n   Rosin. My Lord, there was no such stuffe in my\\nthoughts\\n\\n   Ham. Why did you laugh, when I said, Man delights\\nnot me?\\n  Rosin. To thinke, my Lord, if you delight not in Man,\\nwhat Lenton entertainment the Players shall receiue\\nfrom you: wee coated them on the way, and hither are\\nthey comming to offer you Seruice\\n\\n   Ham. He that playes the King shall be welcome; his\\nMaiesty shall haue Tribute of mee: the aduenturous\\nKnight shal vse his Foyle and Target: the Louer shall\\nnot sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in\\npeace: the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs\\nare tickled a'th' sere: and the Lady shall say her minde\\nfreely; or the blanke Verse shall halt for't: what Players\\nare they?\\n  Rosin. Euen those you were wont to take delight in\\nthe Tragedians of the City\\n\\n   Ham. How chances it they trauaile? their residence\\nboth in reputation and profit was better both\\nwayes\\n\\n   Rosin. I thinke their Inhibition comes by the meanes\\nof the late Innouation?\\n  Ham. Doe they hold the same estimation they did\\nwhen I was in the City? Are they so follow'd?\\n  Rosin. No indeed, they are not\\n\\n   Ham. How comes it? doe they grow rusty?\\n  Rosin. Nay, their indeauour keepes in the wonted\\npace; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children, little\\nYases, that crye out on the top of question; and\\nare most tyrannically clap't for't: these are now the\\nfashion, and so be-ratled the common Stages (so they\\ncall them) that many wearing Rapiers, are affraide of\\nGoose-quils, and dare scarse come thither\\n\\n   Ham. What are they Children? Who maintains 'em?\\nHow are they escorted? Will they pursue the Quality no\\nlonger then they can sing? Will they not say afterwards\\nif they should grow themselues to common Players (as\\nit is most like if their meanes are not better) their Writers\\ndo them wrong, to make them exclaim against their\\nowne Succession\\n\\n   Rosin. Faith there ha's bene much to do on both sides:\\nand the Nation holds it no sinne, to tarre them to Controuersie.\\nThere was for a while, no mony bid for argument,\\nvnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cuffes in\\nthe Question\\n\\n   Ham. Is't possible?\\n  Guild. Oh there ha's beene much throwing about of\\nBraines\\n\\n   Ham. Do the Boyes carry it away?\\n  Rosin. I that they do my Lord. Hercules & his load too\\n\\n   Ham. It is not strange: for mine Vnckle is King of\\nDenmarke, and those that would make mowes at him\\nwhile my Father liued; giue twenty, forty, an hundred\\nDucates a peece, for his picture in Little. There is something\\nin this more then Naturall, if Philosophie could\\nfinde it out.\\n\\nFlourish for the Players.\\n\\n  Guil. There are the Players\\n\\n   Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcom to Elsonower: your\\nhands, come: The appurtenance of Welcome, is Fashion\\nand Ceremony. Let me comply with you in the Garbe,\\nlest my extent to the Players (which I tell you must shew\\nfairely outward) should more appeare like entertainment\\nthen yours. You are welcome: but my Vnckle Father,\\nand Aunt Mother are deceiu'd\\n\\n   Guil. In what my deere Lord?\\n  Ham. I am but mad North, North-West: when the\\nWinde is Southerly, I know a Hawke from a Handsaw.\\nEnter Polonius.\\n\\n  Pol. Well be with you Gentlemen\\n\\n   Ham. Hearke you Guildensterne, and you too: at each\\neare a hearer: that great Baby you see there, is not yet\\nout of his swathing clouts\\n\\n   Rosin. Happily he's the second time come to them: for\\nthey say, an old man is twice a childe\\n\\n   Ham. I will Prophesie. Hee comes to tell me of the\\nPlayers. Mark it, you say right Sir: for a Monday morning\\n'twas so indeed\\n\\n   Pol. My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you\\n\\n   Ham. My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you.\\nWhen Rossius an Actor in Rome-\\n  Pol. The Actors are come hither my Lord\\n\\n   Ham. Buzze, buzze\\n\\n   Pol. Vpon mine Honor\\n\\n   Ham. Then can each Actor on his Asse-\\n  Polon. The best Actors in the world, either for Tragedie,\\nComedie, Historie, Pastorall:\\nPastoricall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:\\nTragicall-Historicall: Tragicall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:\\nScene indiuidible: or Poem\\nvnlimited. Seneca cannot be too heauy, nor Plautus\\ntoo light, for the law of Writ, and the Liberty. These are\\nthe onely men\\n\\n   Ham. O Iephta Iudge of Israel, what a Treasure had'st\\nthou?\\n  Pol. What a Treasure had he, my Lord?\\n  Ham. Why one faire Daughter, and no more,\\nThe which he loued passing well\\n\\n   Pol. Still on my Daughter\\n\\n   Ham. Am I not i'th' right old Iephta?\\n  Polon. If you call me Iephta my Lord, I haue a daughter\\nthat I loue passing well\\n\\n   Ham. Nay that followes not\\n\\n   Polon. What followes then, my Lord?\\n  Ha. Why, As by lot, God wot: and then you know, It\\ncame to passe, as most like it was: The first rowe of the\\nPons Chanson will shew you more. For looke where my\\nAbridgements come.\\nEnter foure or fiue Players.\\n\\nY'are welcome Masters, welcome all. I am glad to see\\nthee well: Welcome good Friends. Oh my olde Friend?\\nThy face is valiant since I saw thee last: Com'st thou to\\nbeard me in Denmarke? What, my yong Lady and Mistris?\\nByrlady your Ladiship is neerer Heauen then when\\nI saw you last, by the altitude of a Choppine. Pray God\\nyour voice like a peece of vncurrant Gold be not crack'd\\nwithin the ring. Masters, you are all welcome: wee'l e'ne\\nto't like French Faulconers, flie at any thing we see: wee'l\\nhaue a Speech straight. Come giue vs a tast of your quality:\\ncome, a passionate speech\\n\\n   1.Play. What speech, my Lord?\\n  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was\\nneuer Acted: or if it was, not aboue once, for the Play I\\nremember pleas'd not the Million, 'twas Cauiarie to the\\nGenerall: but it was (as I receiu'd it, and others, whose\\niudgement in such matters, cried in the top of mine) an\\nexcellent Play; well digested in the Scoenes, set downe\\nwith as much modestie, as cunning. I remember one said,\\nthere was no Sallets in the lines, to make the matter sauory;\\nnor no matter in the phrase, that might indite the\\nAuthor of affectation, but cal'd it an honest method. One\\ncheefe Speech in it, I cheefely lou'd, 'twas Aeneas Tale\\nto Dido, and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks\\nof Priams slaughter. If it liue in your memory, begin at\\nthis Line, let me see, let me see: The rugged Pyrrhus like\\nth'Hyrcanian Beast. It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus\\nThe rugged Pyrrhus, he whose Sable Armes\\nBlacke as his purpose, did the night resemble\\nWhen he lay couched in the Ominous Horse,\\nHath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear'd\\nWith Heraldry more dismall: Head to foote\\nNow is he to take Geulles, horridly Trick'd\\nWith blood of Fathers, Mothers, Daughters, Sonnes,\\nBak'd and impasted with the parching streets,\\nThat lend a tyrannous, and damned light\\nTo their vilde Murthers, roasted in wrath and fire,\\nAnd thus o're-sized with coagulate gore,\\nWith eyes like Carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\\nOlde Grandsire Priam seekes\\n\\n   Pol. Fore God, my Lord, well spoken, with good accent,\\nand good discretion\\n\\n   1.Player. Anon he findes him,\\nStriking too short at Greekes. His anticke Sword,\\nRebellious to his Arme, lyes where it falles\\nRepugnant to command: vnequall match,\\nPyrrhus at Priam driues, in Rage strikes wide:\\nBut with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword,\\nTh' vnnerued Father fals. Then senselesse Illium,\\nSeeming to feele his blow, with flaming top\\nStoopes to his Bace, and with a hideous crash\\nTakes Prisoner Pyrrhus eare. For loe, his Sword\\nWhich was declining on the Milkie head\\nOf Reuerend Priam, seem'd i'th' Ayre to sticke:\\nSo as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhus stood,\\nAnd like a Newtrall to his will and matter, did nothing.\\nBut as we often see against some storme,\\nA silence in the Heauens, the Racke stand still,\\nThe bold windes speechlesse, and the Orbe below\\nAs hush as death: Anon the dreadfull Thunder\\nDoth rend the Region. So after Pyrrhus pause,\\nA rowsed Vengeance sets him new a-worke,\\nAnd neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall\\nOn Mars his Armours, forg'd for proofe Eterne,\\nWith lesse remorse then Pyrrhus bleeding sword\\nNow falles on Priam.\\nOut, out, thou Strumpet-Fortune, all you Gods,\\nIn generall Synod take away her power:\\nBreake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele,\\nAnd boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen,\\nAs low as to the Fiends\\n\\n   Pol. This is too long\\n\\n   Ham. It shall to'th Barbars, with your beard. Prythee\\nsay on: He's for a Iigge, or a tale of Baudry, or hee\\nsleepes. Say on; come to Hecuba\\n\\n   1.Play. But who, O who, had seen the inobled Queen\\n\\n   Ham. The inobled Queene?\\n  Pol. That's good: Inobled Queene is good\\n\\n   1.Play. Run bare-foot vp and downe,\\nThreatning the flame\\nWith Bisson Rheume: A clout about that head,\\nWhere late the Diadem stood, and for a Robe\\nAbout her lanke and all ore-teamed Loines,\\nA blanket in th' Alarum of feare caught vp.\\nWho this had seene, with tongue in Venome steep'd,\\n'Gainst Fortunes State, would Treason haue pronounc'd?\\nBut if the Gods themselues did see her then,\\nWhen she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport\\nIn mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes,\\nThe instant Burst of Clamour that she made\\n(Vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all)\\nWould haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen,\\nAnd passion in the Gods\\n\\n   Pol. Looke where he ha's not turn'd his colour, and\\nha's teares in's eyes. Pray you no more\\n\\n   Ham. 'Tis well, Ile haue thee speake out the rest,\\nsoone. Good my Lord, will you see the Players wel bestow'd.\\nDo ye heare, let them be well vs'd: for they are\\nthe Abstracts and breefe Chronicles of the time. After\\nyour death, you were better haue a bad Epitaph, then\\ntheir ill report while you liued\\n\\n   Pol. My Lord, I will vse them according to their desart\\n\\n   Ham. Gods bodykins man, better. Vse euerie man\\nafter his desart, and who should scape whipping: vse\\nthem after your own Honor and Dignity. The lesse they\\ndeserue, the more merit is in your bountie. Take them\\nin\\n\\n   Pol. Come sirs.\\n\\nExit Polon.\\n\\n  Ham. Follow him Friends: wee'l heare a play to morrow.\\nDost thou heare me old Friend, can you play the\\nmurther of Gonzago?\\n  Play. I my Lord\\n\\n   Ham. Wee'l ha't to morrow night. You could for a\\nneed study a speech of some dosen or sixteene lines, which\\nI would set downe, and insert in't? Could ye not?\\n  Play. I my Lord\\n\\n   Ham. Very well. Follow that Lord, and looke you\\nmock him not. My good Friends, Ile leaue you til night\\nyou are welcome to Elsonower?\\n  Rosin. Good my Lord.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nManet Hamlet.\\n\\n  Ham. I so, God buy'ye: Now I am alone.\\nOh what a Rogue and Pesant slaue am I?\\nIs it not monstrous that this Player heere,\\nBut in a Fixion, in a dreame of Passion,\\nCould force his soule so to his whole conceit,\\nThat from her working, all his visage warm'd;\\nTeares in his eyes, distraction in's Aspect,\\nA broken voyce, and his whole Function suiting\\nWith Formes, to his Conceit? And all for nothing?\\nFor Hecuba?\\nWhat's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\\nThat he should weepe for her? What would he doe,\\nHad he the Motiue and the Cue for passion\\nThat I haue? He would drowne the Stage with teares,\\nAnd cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech:\\nMake mad the guilty, and apale the free,\\nConfound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,\\nThe very faculty of Eyes and Eares. Yet I,\\nA dull and muddy-metled Rascall, peake\\nLike Iohn a-dreames, vnpregnant of my cause,\\nAnd can say nothing: No, not for a King,\\nVpon whose property, and most deere life,\\nA damn'd defeate was made. Am I a Coward?\\nWho calles me Villaine? breakes my pate a-crosse?\\nPluckes off my Beard, and blowes it in my face?\\nTweakes me by'th' Nose? giues me the Lye i'th' Throate,\\nAs deepe as to the Lungs? Who does me this?\\nHa? Why I should take it: for it cannot be,\\nBut I am Pigeon-Liuer'd, and lacke Gall\\nTo make Oppression bitter, or ere this,\\nI should haue fatted all the Region Kites\\nWith this Slaues Offall, bloudy: a Bawdy villaine,\\nRemorselesse, Treacherous, Letcherous, kindles villaine!\\nOh Vengeance!\\nWho? What an Asse am I? I sure, this is most braue,\\nThat I, the Sonne of the Deere murthered,\\nPrompted to my Reuenge by Heauen, and Hell,\\nMust (like a Whore) vnpacke my heart with words,\\nAnd fall a Cursing like a very Drab.\\nA Scullion? Fye vpon't: Foh. About my Braine.\\nI haue heard, that guilty Creatures sitting at a Play,\\nHaue by the very cunning of the Scoene,\\nBene strooke so to the soule, that presently\\nThey haue proclaim'd their Malefactions.\\nFor Murther, though it haue no tongue, will speake\\nWith most myraculous Organ. Ile haue these Players,\\nPlay something like the murder of my Father,\\nBefore mine Vnkle. Ile obserue his lookes,\\nIle rent him to the quicke: If he but blench\\nI know my course. The Spirit that I haue seene\\nMay be the Diuell, and the Diuel hath power\\nT' assume a pleasing shape, yea and perhaps\\nOut of my Weaknesse, and my Melancholly,\\nAs he is very potent with such Spirits,\\nAbuses me to damne me. Ile haue grounds\\nMore Relatiue then this: The Play's the thing,\\nWherein Ile catch the Conscience of the King.\\n\\nExit\\n\\nEnter King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosincrance,\\nGuildenstern, and\\nLords.\\n\\n  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance\\nGet from him why he puts on this Confusion:\\nGrating so harshly all his dayes of quiet\\nWith turbulent and dangerous Lunacy\\n\\n   Rosin. He does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted,\\nBut from what cause he will by no meanes speake\\n\\n   Guil. Nor do we finde him forward to be sounded,\\nBut with a crafty Madnesse keepes aloofe:\\nWhen we would bring him on to some Confession\\nOf his true state\\n\\n   Qu. Did he receiue you well?\\n  Rosin. Most like a Gentleman\\n\\n   Guild. But with much forcing of his disposition\\n\\n   Rosin. Niggard of question, but of our demands\\nMost free in his reply\\n\\n   Qu. Did you assay him to any pastime?\\n  Rosin. Madam, it so fell out, that certaine Players\\nWe ore-wrought on the way: of these we told him,\\nAnd there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy\\nTo heare of it: They are about the Court,\\nAnd (as I thinke) they haue already order\\nThis night to play before him\\n\\n   Pol. 'Tis most true:\\nAnd he beseech'd me to intreate your Maiesties\\nTo heare, and see the matter\\n\\n   King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me\\nTo heare him so inclin'd. Good Gentlemen,\\nGiue him a further edge, and driue his purpose on\\nTo these delights\\n\\n   Rosin. We shall my Lord.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\n  King. Sweet Gertrude leaue vs too,\\nFor we haue closely sent for Hamlet hither,\\nThat he, as 'twere by accident, may there\\nAffront Ophelia. Her Father, and my selfe (lawful espials)\\nWill so bestow our selues, that seeing vnseene\\nWe may of their encounter frankely iudge,\\nAnd gather by him, as he is behaued,\\nIf't be th' affliction of his loue, or no.\\nThat thus he suffers for\\n\\n   Qu. I shall obey you,\\nAnd for your part Ophelia, I do wish\\nThat your good Beauties be the happy cause\\nOf Hamlets wildenesse: so shall I hope your Vertues\\nWill bring him to his wonted way againe,\\nTo both your Honors\\n\\n   Ophe. Madam, I wish it may\\n\\n   Pol. Ophelia, walke you heere. Gracious so please ye\\nWe will bestow our selues: Reade on this booke,\\nThat shew of such an exercise may colour\\nYour lonelinesse. We are oft too blame in this,\\n'Tis too much prou'd, that with Deuotions visage,\\nAnd pious Action, we do surge o're\\nThe diuell himselfe\\n\\n   King. Oh 'tis true:\\nHow smart a lash that speech doth giue my Conscience?\\nThe Harlots Cheeke beautied with plaist'ring Art\\nIs not more vgly to the thing that helpes it,\\nThen is my deede, to my most painted word.\\nOh heauie burthen!\\n  Pol. I heare him comming, let's withdraw my Lord.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nEnter Hamlet.\\n\\n  Ham. To be, or not to be, that is the Question:\\nWhether 'tis Nobler in the minde to suffer\\nThe Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune,\\nOr to take Armes against a Sea of troubles,\\nAnd by opposing end them: to dye, to sleepe\\nNo more; and by a sleepe, to say we end\\nThe Heart-ake, and the thousand Naturall shockes\\nThat Flesh is heyre too? 'Tis a consummation\\nDeuoutly to be wish'd. To dye to sleepe,\\nTo sleepe, perchance to Dreame; I, there's the rub,\\nFor in that sleepe of death, what dreames may come,\\nWhen we haue shuffel'd off this mortall coile,\\nMust giue vs pawse. There's the respect\\nThat makes Calamity of so long life:\\nFor who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time,\\nThe Oppressors wrong, the poore mans Contumely,\\nThe pangs of dispriz'd Loue, the Lawes delay,\\nThe insolence of Office, and the Spurnes\\nThat patient merit of the vnworthy takes,\\nWhen he himselfe might his Quietus make\\nWith a bare Bodkin? Who would these Fardles beare\\nTo grunt and sweat vnder a weary life,\\nBut that the dread of something after death,\\nThe vndiscouered Countrey, from whose Borne\\nNo Traueller returnes, Puzels the will,\\nAnd makes vs rather beare those illes we haue,\\nThen flye to others that we know not of.\\nThus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all,\\nAnd thus the Natiue hew of Resolution\\nIs sicklied o're, with the pale cast of Thought,\\nAnd enterprizes of great pith and moment,\\nWith this regard their Currants turne away,\\nAnd loose the name of Action. Soft you now,\\nThe faire Ophelia? Nimph, in thy Orizons\\nBe all my sinnes remembred\\n\\n   Ophe. Good my Lord,\\nHow does your Honor for this many a day?\\n  Ham. I humbly thanke you: well, well, well\\n\\n   Ophe. My Lord, I haue Remembrances of yours,\\nThat I haue longed long to re-deliuer.\\nI pray you now, receiue them\\n\\n   Ham. No, no, I neuer gaue you ought\\n\\n   Ophe. My honor'd Lord, I know right well you did,\\nAnd with them words of so sweet breath compos'd,\\nAs made the things more rich, then perfume left:\\nTake these againe, for to the Noble minde\\nRich gifts wax poore, when giuers proue vnkinde.\\nThere my Lord\\n\\n   Ham. Ha, ha: Are you honest?\\n  Ophe. My Lord\\n\\n   Ham. Are you faire?\\n  Ophe. What meanes your Lordship?\\n  Ham. That if you be honest and faire, your Honesty\\nshould admit no discourse to your Beautie\\n\\n   Ophe. Could Beautie my Lord, haue better Comerce\\nthen your Honestie?\\n  Ham. I trulie: for the power of Beautie, will sooner\\ntransforme Honestie from what is, to a Bawd, then the\\nforce of Honestie can translate Beautie into his likenesse.\\nThis was sometime a Paradox, but now the time giues it\\nproofe. I did loue you once\\n\\n   Ophe. Indeed my Lord, you made me beleeue so\\n\\n   Ham. You should not haue beleeued me. For vertue\\ncannot so innocculate our old stocke, but we shall rellish\\nof it. I loued you not\\n\\n   Ophe. I was the more deceiued\\n\\n   Ham. Get thee to a Nunnerie. Why would'st thou\\nbe a breeder of Sinners? I am my selfe indifferent honest,\\nbut yet I could accuse me of such things, that it were better\\nmy Mother had not borne me. I am very prowd, reuengefull,\\nAmbitious, with more offences at my becke,\\nthen I haue thoughts to put them in imagination, to giue\\nthem shape, or time to acte them in. What should such\\nFellowes as I do, crawling betweene Heauen and Earth.\\nWe are arrant Knaues all, beleeue none of vs. Goe thy\\nwayes to a Nunnery. Where's your Father?\\n  Ophe. At home, my Lord\\n\\n   Ham. Let the doores be shut vpon him, that he may\\nplay the Foole no way, but in's owne house. Farewell\\n\\n   Ophe. O helpe him, you sweet Heauens\\n\\n   Ham. If thou doest Marry, Ile giue thee this Plague\\nfor thy Dowrie. Be thou as chast as Ice, as pure as Snow,\\nthou shalt not escape Calumny. Get thee to a Nunnery.\\nGo, Farewell. Or if thou wilt needs Marry, marry a fool:\\nfor Wise men know well enough, what monsters you\\nmake of them. To a Nunnery go, and quickly too. Farwell\\n\\n   Ophe. O heauenly Powers, restore him\\n\\n   Ham. I haue heard of your pratlings too wel enough.\\nGod has giuen you one pace, and you make your selfe another:\\nyou gidge, you amble, and you lispe, and nickname\\nGods creatures, and make your Wantonnesse, your Ignorance.\\nGo too, Ile no more on't, it hath made me mad.\\nI say, we will haue no more Marriages. Those that are\\nmarried already, all but one shall liue, the rest shall keep\\nas they are. To a Nunnery, go.\\n\\nExit Hamlet.\\n\\n  Ophe. O what a Noble minde is heere o're-throwne?\\nThe Courtiers, Soldiers, Schollers: Eye, tongue, sword,\\nTh' expectansie and Rose of the faire State,\\nThe glasse of Fashion, and the mould of Forme,\\nTh' obseru'd of all Obseruers, quite, quite downe.\\nHaue I of Ladies most deiect and wretched,\\nThat suck'd the Honie of his Musicke Vowes:\\nNow see that Noble, and most Soueraigne Reason,\\nLike sweet Bels iangled out of tune, and harsh,\\nThat vnmatch'd Forme and Feature of blowne youth,\\nBlasted with extasie. Oh woe is me,\\nT'haue seene what I haue seene: see what I see.\\nEnter King, and Polonius.\\n\\n  King. Loue? His affections do not that way tend,\\nNor what he spake, though it lack'd Forme a little,\\nWas not like Madnesse. There's something in his soule?\\nO're which his Melancholly sits on brood,\\nAnd I do doubt the hatch, and the disclose\\nWill be some danger, which to preuent\\nI haue in quicke determination\\nThus set it downe. He shall with speed to England\\nFor the demand of our neglected Tribute:\\nHaply the Seas and Countries different\\nWith variable Obiects, shall expell\\nThis something setled matter in his heart:\\nWhereon his Braines still beating, puts him thus\\nFrom fashion of himselfe.

O it offends mee to the Soule,\\nto see a robustious Pery-wig-pated Fellow, teare a Passion\\nto tatters, to verie ragges, to split the eares of the\\nGroundlings: who (for the most part) are capeable of\\nnothing, but inexplicable dumbe shewes, & noise: I could\\nhaue such a Fellow whipt for o're-doing Termagant: it\\noutHerod's Herod.

Now, this\\nouer-done, or come tardie off, though it make the vnskilfull\\nlaugh, cannot but make the Iudicious greeue; The\\ncensure of the which One, must in your allowance o'reway\\na whole Theater of Others. Oh, there bee Players\\nthat I haue seene Play, and heard others praise, and that\\nhighly (not to speake it prophanely) that neyther hauing\\nthe accent of Christians, nor the gate of Christian, Pagan,\\nor Norman, haue so strutted and bellowed, that I haue\\nthought some of Natures Iouerney-men had made men,\\nand not made them well, they imitated Humanity so abhominably\\n\\n   Play.

For there be of them, that will themselues laugh,\\nto set on some quantitie of barren Spectators to laugh\\ntoo, though in the meane time, some necessary Question\\nof the Play be then to be considered: that's Villanous, &\\nshewes a most pittifull Ambition in the Foole that vses\\nit.

What haue I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tong,\\nIn noise so rude against me?\\n  Ham. Such an Act\\nThat blurres the grace and blush of Modestie,\\nCals Vertue Hypocrite, takes off the Rose\\nFrom the faire forehead of an innocent loue,\\nAnd makes a blister there. Makes marriage vowes\\nAs false as Dicers Oathes. Oh such a deed,\\nAs from the body of Contraction pluckes\\nThe very soule, and sweete Religion makes\\nA rapsidie of words.

Ha? Haue you eyes?\\nYou cannot call it Loue: For at your age,\\nThe hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,\\nAnd waites vpon the Iudgement: and what Iudgement\\nWould step from this, to this? What diuell was't,\\nThat thus hath cousend you at hoodman-blinde?\\nO Shame! where is thy Blush? Rebellious Hell,\\nIf thou canst mutine in a Matrons bones,\\nTo flaming youth, let Vertue be as waxe.\\nAnd melt in her owne fire. Proclaime no shame,\\nWhen the compulsiue Ardure giues the charge,\\nSince Frost it selfe, as actiuely doth burne,\\nAs Reason panders Will\\n\\n   Qu. O Hamlet, speake no more.\\nThou turn'st mine eyes into my very soule,\\nAnd there I see such blacke and grained spots,\\nAs will not leaue their Tinct\\n\\n   Ham.

Oh speake to me, no more,\\nThese words like Daggers enter in mine eares.\\nNo more sweet Hamlet\\n\\n   Ham. A Murderer, and a Villaine:\\nA Slaue, that is not twentieth part the tythe\\nOf your precedent Lord.

Do not forget: this Visitation\\nIs but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.\\nBut looke, Amazement on thy Mother sits;\\nO step betweene her, and her fighting Soule,\\nConceit in weakest bodies, strongest workes.\\nSpeake to her Hamlet\\n\\n   Ham. How is it with you Lady?\\n  Qu. Alas, how is't with you?\\nThat you bend your eye on vacancie,\\nAnd with their corporall ayre do hold discourse.\\nForth at your eyes, your spirits wildely peepe,\\nAnd as the sleeping Soldiours in th' Alarme,\\nYour bedded haire, like life in excrements,\\nStart vp, and stand an end. Oh gentle Sonne,\\nVpon the heate and flame of thy distemper\\nSprinkle coole patience. Whereon do you looke?\\n  Ham. On him, on him: look you how pale he glares,\\nHis forme and cause conioyn'd, preaching to stones,\\nWould make them capeable. Do not looke vpon me,\\nLeast with this pitteous action you conuert\\nMy sterne effects: then what I haue to do,\\nWill want true colour; teares perchance for blood\\n\\n   Qu.

Why look you there: looke how it steals away:\\nMy Father in his habite, as he liued,\\nLooke where he goes euen now out at the Portall.\\nEnter.\\n\\n  Qu. This is the very coynage of your Braine,\\nThis bodilesse Creation extasie is very cunning in\\n\\n   Ham. Extasie?\\nMy Pulse as yours doth temperately keepe time,\\nAnd makes as healthfull Musicke. It is not madnesse\\nThat I haue vttered; bring me to the Test\\nAnd I the matter will re-word: which madnesse\\nWould gamboll from. Mother, for loue of Grace,\\nLay not a flattering Vnction to your soule,\\nThat not your trespasse, but my madnesse speakes:\\nIt will but skin and filme the Vlcerous place,\\nWhil'st ranke Corruption mining all within,\\nInfects vnseene. Confesse your selfe to Heauen,\\nRepent what's past, auoyd what is to come,\\nAnd do not spred the Compost on the Weedes,\\nTo make them ranke. Forgiue me this my Vertue,\\nFor in the fatnesse of this pursie times,\\nVertue it selfe, of Vice must pardon begge,\\nYea courb, and woe, for leaue to do him good\\n\\n   Qu. Oh Hamlet,\\nThou hast cleft my heart in twaine\\n\\n   Ham. O throw away the worser part of it,\\nAnd liue the purer with the other halfe.\\nGood night, but go not to mine Vnkles bed,\\nAssume a Vertue, if you haue it not, refraine to night,\\nAnd that shall lend a kinde of easinesse\\nTo the next abstinence. Once more goodnight,\\nAnd when you are desirous to be blest,\\nIle blessing begge of you. For this same Lord,\\nI do repent: but heauen hath pleas'd it so,\\nTo punish me with this, and this with me,\\nThat I must be their Scourge and Minister.\\nI will bestow him, and will answer well\\nThe death I gaue him: so againe, good night.\\nI must be cruell, onely to be kinde;\\nThus bad begins and worse remaines behinde\\n\\n   Qu.

Of them\\nI haue much to tell thee, Farewell.\\nHe that thou knowest thine,\\nHamlet.\\nCome, I will giue you way for these your Letters,\\nAnd do't the speedier, that you may direct me\\nTo him from whom you brought them.\\nEnter.\\n\\nEnter King and Laertes.\\n\\n  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,\\nAnd you must put me in your heart for Friend,\\nSith you haue heard, and with a knowing eare,\\nThat he which hath your Noble Father slaine,\\nPursued my life\\n\\n   Laer. It well appeares. But tell me,\\nWhy you proceeded not against these feates,\\nSo crimefull, and so Capitall in Nature,\\nAs by your Safety, Wisedome, all things else,\\nYou mainly were stirr'd vp?\\n  King. O for two speciall Reasons,\\nWhich may to you (perhaps) seeme much vnsinnowed,\\nAnd yet to me they are strong. The Queen his Mother,\\nLiues almost by his lookes: and for my selfe,\\nMy Vertue or my Plague, be it either which,\\nShe's so coniunctiue to my life, and soule;\\nThat as the Starre moues not but in his Sphere,\\nI could not but by her. The other Motiue,\\nWhy to a publike count I might not go,\\nIs the great loue the generall gender beare him,\\nWho dipping all his Faults in their affection,\\nWould like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone,\\nConuert his Gyues to Graces. So that my Arrowes\\nToo slightly timbred for so loud a Winde,\\nWould haue reuerted to my Bow againe,\\nAnd not where I had arm'd them\\n\\n   Laer. And so haue I a Noble Father lost,\\nA Sister driuen into desperate tearmes,\\nWho was (if praises may go backe againe)\\nStood Challenger on mount of all the Age\\nFor her perfections. But my reuenge will come\\n\\n   King. Breake not your sleepes for that,\\nYou must not thinke\\nThat we are made of stuffe, so flat, and dull,\\nThat we can let our Beard be shooke with danger,\\nAnd thinke it pastime. You shortly shall heare more,\\nI lou'd your Father, and we loue our Selfe,\\nAnd that I hope will teach you to imagine-\\nEnter a Messenger.\\n\\nHow now? What Newes?\\n  Mes. Letters my Lord from Hamlet, This to your\\nMaiesty: this to the Queene\\n\\n   King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?\\n  Mes. Saylors my Lord they say, I saw them not:\\nThey were giuen me by Claudio, he receiu'd them\\n\\n   King. Laertes you shall heare them:\\nLeaue vs.\\n\\nExit Messenger\\n\\nHigh and Mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your\\nKingdome. To morrow shall I begge leaue to see your Kingly\\nEyes. When I shall (first asking your Pardon thereunto) recount\\nth' Occasions of my sodaine, and more strange returne.\\nHamlet.\\nWhat should this meane? Are all the rest come backe?\\nOr is it some abuse? Or no such thing?\\n  Laer. Know you the hand?\\n  Kin. 'Tis Hamlets Character, naked and in a Postscript\\nhere he sayes alone: Can you aduise me?\\n  Laer. I'm lost in it my Lord; but let him come,\\nIt warmes the very sicknesse in my heart,\\nThat I shall liue and tell him to his teeth;\\nThus diddest thou\\n\\n   Kin. If it be so Laertes, as how should it be so:\\nHow otherwise will you be rul'd by me?\\n  Laer. If so you'l not o'rerule me to a peace\\n\\n   Kin. To thine owne peace: if he be now return'd,\\nAs checking at his Voyage, and that he meanes\\nNo more to vndertake it; I will worke him\\nTo an exployt now ripe in my Deuice,\\nVnder the which he shall not choose but fall;\\nAnd for his death no winde of blame shall breath,\\nBut euen his Mother shall vncharge the practice,\\nAnd call it accident: Some two Monthes hence\\nHere was a Gentleman of Normandy,\\nI'ue seene my selfe, and seru'd against the French,\\nAnd they ran well on Horsebacke; but this Gallant\\nHad witchcraft in't; he grew into his Seat,\\nAnd to such wondrous doing brought his Horse,\\nAs had he beene encorps't and demy-Natur'd\\nWith the braue Beast, so farre he past my thought,\\nThat I in forgery of shapes and trickes,\\nCome short of what he did\\n\\n   Laer. A Norman was't?\\n  Kin. A Norman\\n\\n   Laer. Vpon my life Lamound\\n\\n   Kin. The very same\\n\\n   Laer. I know him well, he is the Brooch indeed,\\nAnd Iemme of all our Nation\\n\\n   Kin. Hee mad confession of you,\\nAnd gaue you such a Masterly report,\\nFor Art and exercise in your defence;\\nAnd for your Rapier most especiall,\\nThat he cryed out, t'would be a sight indeed,\\nIf one could match you Sir. This report of his\\nDid Hamlet so envenom with his Enuy,\\nThat he could nothing doe but wish and begge,\\nYour sodaine comming ore to play with him;\\nNow out of this\\n\\n   Laer. Why out of this, my Lord?\\n  Kin. Laertes was your Father deare to you?\\nOr are you like the painting of a sorrow,\\nA face without a heart?\\n  Laer. Why aske you this?\\n  Kin. Not that I thinke you did not loue your Father,\\nBut that I know Loue is begun by Time:\\nAnd that I see in passages of proofe,\\nTime qualifies the sparke and fire of it:\\nHamlet comes backe: what would you vndertake,\\nTo show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed,\\nMore then in words?\\n  Laer. To cut his throat i'th' Church\\n\\n   Kin. No place indeed should murder Sancturize;\\nReuenge should haue no bounds: but good Laertes\\nWill you doe this, keepe close within your Chamber,\\nHamlet return'd, shall know you are come home:\\nWee'l put on those shall praise your excellence,\\nAnd set a double varnish on the fame\\nThe Frenchman gaue you, bring you in fine together,\\nAnd wager on your heads, he being remisse,\\nMost generous, and free from all contriuing,\\nWill not peruse the Foiles? So that with ease,\\nOr with a little shuffling, you may choose\\nA Sword vnbaited, and in a passe of practice,\\nRequit him for your Father\\n\\n   Laer. I will doo't.\\nAnd for that purpose Ile annoint my Sword:\\nI bought an Vnction of a Mountebanke\\nSo mortall, I but dipt a knife in it,\\nWhere it drawes blood, no Cataplasme so rare,\\nCollected from all Simples that haue Vertue\\nVnder the Moone, can saue the thing from death,\\nThat is but scratcht withall: Ile touch my point,\\nWith this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,\\nIt may be death\\n\\n   Kin. Let's further thinke of this,\\nWeigh what conuenience both of time and meanes\\nMay fit vs to our shape, if this should faile;\\nAnd that our drift looke through our bad performance,\\n'Twere better not assaid; therefore this Proiect\\nShould haue a backe or second, that might hold,\\nIf this should blast in proofe: Soft, let me see\\nWee'l make a solemne wager on your commings,\\nI ha't: when in your motion you are hot and dry,\\nAs make your bowts more violent to the end,\\nAnd that he cals for drinke; Ile haue prepar'd him\\nA Challice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,\\nIf he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,\\nOur purpose may hold there; how sweet Queene.\\nEnter Queene.\\n\\n  Queen. One woe doth tread vpon anothers heele,\\nSo fast they'l follow: your Sister's drown'd Laertes\\n\\n   Laer. Drown'd! O where?\\n  Queen. There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke,\\nThat shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame:\\nThere with fantasticke Garlands did she come,\\nOf Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daysies, and long Purples,\\nThat liberall Shepheards giue a grosser name;\\nBut our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them:\\nThere on the pendant boughes, her Coronet weeds\\nClambring to hang; an enuious sliuer broke,\\nWhen downe the weedy Trophies, and her selfe,\\nFell in the weeping Brooke, her cloathes spred wide,\\nAnd Mermaid-like, a while they bore her vp,\\nWhich time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,\\nAs one incapable of her owne distresse,\\nOr like a creature Natiue, and indued\\nVnto that Element: but long it could not be,\\nTill that her garments, heauy with her drinke,\\nPul'd the poore wretch from her melodious buy,\\nTo muddy death\\n\\n   Laer. Alas then, is she drown'd?\\n  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd\\n\\n   Laer. Too much of water hast thou poore Ophelia,\\nAnd therefore I forbid my teares: but yet\\nIt is our tricke, Nature her custome holds,\\nLet shame say what it will; when these are gone\\nThe woman will be out: Adue my Lord,\\nI haue a speech of fire, that faine would blaze,\\nBut that this folly doubts it.\\nEnter.\\n\\n  Kin. Let's follow, Gertrude:\\nHow much I had to doe to calme his rage?\\nNow feare I this will giue it start againe;\\nTherefore let's follow.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nEnter two Clownes.\\n\\n  Clown. Is she to bee buried in Christian buriall, that\\nwilfully seekes her owne saluation?\\n  Other. I tell thee she is, and therefore make her Graue\\nstraight, the Crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian\\nburiall\\n\\n   Clo. How can that be, vnlesse she drowned her selfe in\\nher owne defence?\\n  Other. Why 'tis found so\\n\\n   Clo. It must be Se offendendo, it cannot bee else: for\\nheere lies the point; If I drowne my selfe wittingly, it argues\\nan Act: and an Act hath three branches. It is an\\nAct to doe and to performe; argall she drown'd her selfe\\nwittingly\\n\\n   Other. Nay but heare you Goodman Deluer\\n\\n   Clown. Giue me leaue; heere lies the water; good:\\nheere stands the man; good: If the man goe to this water\\nand drowne himselfe; it is will he nill he, he goes;\\nmarke you that? But if the water come to him & drowne\\nhim; hee drownes not himselfe. Argall, hee that is not\\nguilty of his owne death, shortens not his owne life\\n\\n   Other. But is this law?\\n  Clo. I marry is't, Crowners Quest Law\\n\\n   Other. Will you ha the truth on't: if this had not\\nbeene a Gentlewoman, shee should haue beene buried\\nout of Christian Buriall\\n\\n   Clo. Why there thou say'st. And the more pitty that\\ngreat folke should haue countenance in this world to\\ndrowne or hang themselues, more then their euen Christian.\\nCome, my Spade; there is no ancient Gentlemen,\\nbut Gardiners, Ditchers and Graue-makers; they hold vp\\nAdams Profession\\n\\n   Other. Was he a Gentleman?\\n  Clo. He was the first that euer bore Armes\\n\\n   Other. Why he had none\\n\\n   Clo. What, ar't a Heathen? how doth thou vnderstand\\nthe Scripture? the Scripture sayes Adam dig'd;\\ncould hee digge without Armes? Ile put another question\\nto thee; if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confesse\\nthy selfe-\\n  Other. Go too\\n\\n   Clo. What is he that builds stronger then either the\\nMason, the Shipwright, or the Carpenter?\\n  Other. The Gallowes maker; for that Frame outliues a\\nthousand Tenants\\n\\n   Clo. I like thy wit well in good faith, the Gallowes\\ndoes well; but how does it well? it does well to those\\nthat doe ill: now, thou dost ill to say the Gallowes is\\nbuilt stronger then the Church: Argall, the Gallowes\\nmay doe well to thee. Too't againe, Come\\n\\n   Other. Who builds stronger then a Mason, a Shipwright,\\nor a Carpenter?\\n  Clo. I, tell me that, and vnyoake\\n\\n   Other. Marry, now I can tell\\n\\n   Clo. Too't\\n\\n   Other. Masse, I cannot tell.\\nEnter Hamlet and Horatio a farre off.\\n\\n  Clo. Cudgell thy braines no more about it; for your\\ndull Asse will not mend his pace with beating; and when\\nyou are ask't this question next, say a Graue-maker: the\\nHouses that he makes, lasts till Doomesday: go, get thee\\nto Yaughan, fetch me a stoupe of Liquor.\\n\\nSings.\\n\\nIn youth when I did loue, did loue,\\nme thought it was very sweete:\\nTo contract O the time for a my behoue,\\nO me thought there was nothing meete\\n\\n   Ham. Ha's this fellow no feeling of his businesse, that\\nhe sings at Graue-making?\\n  Hor. Custome hath made it in him a property of easinesse\\n\\n   Ham. 'Tis ee'n so; the hand of little Imployment hath\\nthe daintier sense\\n\\n   Clowne sings. But Age with his stealing steps\\nhath caught me in his clutch:\\nAnd hath shipped me intill the Land,\\nas if I had neuer beene such\\n\\n   Ham. That Scull had a tongue in it, and could sing\\nonce: how the knaue iowles it to th' grownd, as if it\\nwere Caines Iaw-bone, that did the first murther: It\\nmight be the Pate of a Polititian which this Asse o're Offices:\\none that could circumuent God, might it not?\\n  Hor. It might, my Lord\\n\\n   Ham. Or of a Courtier, which could say, Good Morrow\\nsweet Lord: how dost thou, good Lord? this\\nmight be my Lord such a one, that prais'd my Lord such\\na ones Horse, when he meant to begge it; might it not?\\n  Hor. I, my Lord\\n\\n   Ham. Why ee'n so: and now my Lady Wormes,\\nChaplesse, and knockt about the Mazard with a Sextons\\nSpade; heere's fine Reuolution, if wee had the tricke to\\nsee't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but\\nto play at Loggets with 'em? mine ake to thinke\\non't\\n\\n   Clowne sings. A Pickhaxe and a Spade, a Spade,\\nfor and a shrowding-Sheete:\\nO a Pit of Clay for to be made,\\nfor such a Guest is meete\\n\\n   Ham. There's another: why might not that bee the\\nScull of a Lawyer? where be his Quiddits now? his\\nQuillets? his Cases? his Tenures, and his Tricks? why\\ndoe's he suffer this rude knaue now to knocke him about\\nthe Sconce with a dirty Shouell, and will not tell him of\\nhis Action of Battery? hum. This fellow might be in's\\ntime a great buyer of Land, with his Statutes, his Recognizances,\\nhis Fines, his double Vouchers, his Recoueries:\\nIs this the fine of his Fines, and the recouery of his Recoueries,\\nto haue his fine Pate full of fine Dirt? will his\\nVouchers vouch him no more of his Purchases, and double\\nones too, then the length and breadth of a paire of\\nIndentures? the very Conueyances of his Lands will\\nhardly lye in this Boxe; and must the Inheritor himselfe\\nhaue no more? ha?\\n  Hor. Not a iot more, my Lord\\n\\n   Ham. Is not Parchment made of Sheep-skinnes?\\n  Hor. I my Lord, and of Calue-skinnes too\\n\\n   Ham. They are Sheepe and Calues that seek out assurance\\nin that. I will speake to this fellow: whose Graue's\\nthis Sir?\\n  Clo. Mine Sir:\\nO a Pit of Clay for to be made,\\nfor such a Guest is meete\\n\\n   Ham. I thinke it be thine indeed: for thou liest in't\\n\\n   Clo. You lye out on't Sir, and therefore it is not yours:\\nfor my part, I doe not lye in't; and yet it is mine\\n\\n   Ham. Thou dost lye in't, to be in't and say 'tis thine:\\n'tis for the dead, not for the quicke, therefore thou\\nlyest\\n\\n   Clo. 'Tis a quicke lye Sir, 'twill away againe from me\\nto you\\n\\n   Ham. What man dost thou digge it for?\\n  Clo. For no man Sir\\n\\n   Ham. What woman then?\\n  Clo. For none neither\\n\\n   Ham. Who is to be buried in't?\\n  Clo. One that was a woman Sir; but rest her Soule,\\nshee's dead\\n\\n   Ham. How absolute the knaue is? wee must speake\\nby the Carde, or equiuocation will vndoe vs: by the\\nLord Horatio, these three yeares I haue taken note of it,\\nthe Age is growne so picked, that the toe of the Pesant\\ncomes so neere the heeles of our Courtier, hee galls his\\nKibe. How long hast thou been a Graue-maker?\\n  Clo. Of all the dayes i'th' yeare, I came too't that day\\nthat our last King Hamlet o'recame Fortinbras\\n\\n   Ham. How long is that since?\\n  Clo. Cannot you tell that? euery foole can tell that:\\nIt was the very day, that young Hamlet was borne, hee\\nthat was mad, and sent into England\\n\\n   Ham. I marry, why was he sent into England?\\n  Clo. Why, because he was mad; hee shall recouer his\\nwits there; or if he do not, it's no great matter there\\n\\n   Ham. Why?\\n  Clo. 'Twill not be seene in him, there the men are as\\nmad as he\\n\\n   Ham. How came he mad?\\n  Clo. Very strangely they say\\n\\n   Ham. How strangely?\\n  Clo. Faith e'ene with loosing his wits\\n\\n   Ham. Vpon what ground?\\n  Clo. Why heere in Denmarke: I haue bin sixeteene\\nheere, man and Boy thirty yeares\\n\\n   Ham. How long will a man lie i'th' earth ere he rot?\\n  Clo. Ifaith, if he be not rotten before he die (as we haue\\nmany pocky Coarses now adaies, that will scarce hold\\nthe laying in) he will last you some eight yeare, or nine\\nyeare. A Tanner will last you nine yeare\\n\\n   Ham. Why he, more then another?\\n  Clo. Why sir, his hide is so tan'd with his Trade, that\\nhe will keepe out water a great while. And your water,\\nis a sore Decayer of your horson dead body. Heres a Scull\\nnow: this Scul, has laine in the earth three & twenty years\\n\\n   Ham. Whose was it?\\n  Clo. A whoreson mad Fellowes it was;\\nWhose doe you thinke it was?\\n  Ham. Nay, I know not\\n\\n   Clo. A pestilence on him for a mad Rogue, a pour'd a\\nFlaggon of Renish on my head once. This same Scull\\nSir, this same Scull sir, was Yoricks Scull, the Kings Iester\\n\\n   Ham. This?\\n  Clo. E'ene that\\n\\n   Ham. Let me see. Alas poore Yorick, I knew him Horatio,\\na fellow of infinite Iest; of most excellent fancy, he\\nhath borne me on his backe a thousand times: And how\\nabhorred my Imagination is, my gorge rises at it. Heere\\nhung those lipps, that I haue kist I know not how oft.\\nWhere be your Iibes now? Your Gambals? Your\\nSongs? Your flashes of Merriment that were wont to\\nset the Table on a Rore? No one now to mock your own\\nIeering? Quite chopfalne? Now get you to my Ladies\\nChamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thicke, to this\\nfauour she must come. Make her laugh at that: prythee\\nHoratio tell me one thing\\n\\n   Hor. What's that my Lord?\\n  Ham. Dost thou thinke Alexander lookt o'this fashion\\ni'th' earth?\\n  Hor. E'ene so\\n\\n   Ham. And smelt so? Puh\\n\\n   Hor. E'ene so, my Lord\\n\\n   Ham. To what base vses we may returne Horatio.\\nWhy may not Imagination trace the Noble dust of Alexander,\\ntill he find it stopping a bunghole\\n\\n   Hor. 'Twere to consider: to curiously to consider so\\n\\n   Ham. No faith, not a iot. But to follow him thether\\nwith modestie enough, & likeliehood to lead it; as thus.\\nAlexander died: Alexander was buried: Alexander returneth\\ninto dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make\\nLome, and why of that Lome (whereto he was conuerted)\\nmight they not stopp a Beere-barrell?\\nImperiall Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,\\nMight stop a hole to keepe the winde away.\\nOh, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,\\nShould patch a Wall, t' expell the winters flaw.\\nBut soft, but soft, aside; heere comes the King.\\nEnter King, Queene, Laertes, and a Coffin, with Lords attendant.\\n\\nThe Queene, the Courtiers. Who is that they follow,\\nAnd with such maimed rites? This doth betoken,\\nThe Coarse they follow, did with disperate hand,\\nFore do it owne life; 'twas some Estate.\\nCouch we a while, and mark\\n\\n   Laer. What Cerimony else?\\n  Ham. That is Laertes, a very Noble youth: Marke\\n\\n   Laer. What Cerimony else?\\n  Priest. Her Obsequies haue bin as farre inlarg'd.\\nAs we haue warrantie, her death was doubtfull,\\nAnd but that great Command, o're-swaies the order,\\nShe should in ground vnsanctified haue lodg'd,\\nTill the last Trumpet. For charitable praier,\\nShardes, Flints, and Peebles, should be throwne on her:\\nYet heere she is allowed her Virgin Rites,\\nHer Maiden strewments, and the bringing home\\nOf Bell and Buriall\\n\\n   Laer. Must there no more be done ?\\n  Priest. No more be done:\\nWe should prophane the seruice of the dead,\\nTo sing sage Requiem, and such rest to her\\nAs to peace-parted Soules\\n\\n   Laer. Lay her i'th' earth,\\nAnd from her faire and vnpolluted flesh,\\nMay Violets spring. I tell thee (churlish Priest)\\nA Ministring Angell shall my Sister be,\\nWhen thou liest howling?\\n  Ham. What, the faire Ophelia?\\n  Queene. Sweets, to the sweet farewell.\\nI hop'd thou should'st haue bin my Hamlets wife:\\nI thought thy Bride-bed to haue deckt (sweet Maid)\\nAnd not t'haue strew'd thy Graue\\n\\n   Laer. Oh terrible woer,\\nFall ten times trebble, on that cursed head\\nWhose wicked deed, thy most Ingenious sence\\nDepriu'd thee of. Hold off the earth a while,\\nTill I haue caught her once more in mine armes:\\n\\nLeaps in the graue.\\n\\nNow pile your dust, vpon the quicke, and dead,\\nTill of this flat a Mountaine you haue made,\\nTo o're top old Pelion, or the skyish head\\nOf blew Olympus\\n\\n   Ham. What is he, whose griefes\\nBeares such an Emphasis? whose phrase of Sorrow\\nConiure the wandring Starres, and makes them stand\\nLike wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,\\nHamlet the Dane\\n\\n   Laer. The deuill take thy soule\\n\\n   Ham. Thou prai'st not well,\\nI prythee take thy fingers from my throat;\\nSir though I am not Spleenatiue, and rash,\\nYet haue I something in me dangerous,\\nWhich let thy wisenesse feare. Away thy hand\\n\\n   King. Pluck them asunder\\n\\n   Qu. Hamlet, Hamlet\\n\\n   Gen. Good my Lord be quiet\\n\\n   Ham. Why I will fight with him vppon this Theme.\\nVntill my eielids will no longer wag\\n\\n   Qu. Oh my Sonne, what Theame?\\n  Ham. I lou'd Ophelia; fortie thousand Brothers\\nCould not (with all there quantitie of Loue)\\nMake vp my summe. What wilt thou do for her?\\n  King. Oh he is mad Laertes,\\n  Qu. For loue of God forbeare him\\n\\n   Ham. Come show me what thou'lt doe.\\nWoo't weepe? Woo't fight? Woo't teare thy selfe?\\nWoo't drinke vp Esile, eate a Crocodile?\\nIle doo't. Dost thou come heere to whine;\\nTo outface me with leaping in her Graue?\\nBe buried quicke with her, and so will I.\\nAnd if thou prate of Mountaines; let them throw\\nMillions of Akers on vs; till our ground\\nSindging his pate against the burning Zone,\\nMake Ossa like a wart. Nay, and thou'lt mouth,\\nIle rant as well as thou\\n\\n   Kin. This is meere Madnesse:\\nAnd thus awhile the fit will worke on him:\\nAnon as patient as the female Doue,\\nWhen that her Golden Cuplet are disclos'd;\\nHis silence will sit drooping\\n\\n   Ham. Heare you Sir:\\nWhat is the reason that you vse me thus?\\nI lou'd you euer; but it is no matter:\\nLet Hercules himselfe doe what he may,\\nThe Cat will Mew, and Dogge will haue his day.\\nEnter.\\n\\n  Kin. I pray you good Horatio wait vpon him,\\nStrengthen your patience in our last nights speech,\\nWee'l put the matter to the present push:\\nGood Gertrude set some watch ouer your Sonne,\\nThis Graue shall haue a liuing Monument:\\nAn houre of quiet shortly shall we see;\\nTill then, in patience our proceeding be.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nEnter Hamlet and Horatio\\n\\n   Ham. So much for this Sir; now let me see the other,\\nYou doe remember all the Circumstance\\n\\n   Hor. Remember it my Lord?\\n  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kinde of fighting,\\nThat would not let me sleepe; me thought I lay\\nWorse then the mutines in the Bilboes, rashly,\\n(And praise be rashnesse for it) let vs know,\\nOur indiscretion sometimes serues vs well,\\nWhen our deare plots do paule, and that should teach vs,\\nThere's a Diuinity that shapes our ends,\\nRough-hew them how we will\\n\\n   Hor. That is most certaine\\n\\n   Ham. Vp from my Cabin\\nMy sea-gowne scarft about me in the darke,\\nGrop'd I to finde out them; had my desire,\\nFinger'd their Packet, and in fine, withdrew\\nTo mine owne roome againe, making so bold,\\n(My feares forgetting manners) to vnseale\\nTheir grand Commission, where I found Horatio,\\nOh royall knauery: An exact command,\\nLarded with many seuerall sorts of reason;\\nImporting Denmarks health, and Englands too,\\nWith hoo, such Bugges and Goblins in my life,\\nThat on the superuize no leasure bated,\\nNo not to stay the grinding of the Axe,\\nMy head should be struck off\\n\\n   Hor. Ist possible?\\n  Ham. Here's the Commission, read it at more leysure:\\nBut wilt thou heare me how I did proceed?\\n  Hor. I beseech you\\n\\n   Ham. Being thus benetted round with Villaines,\\nEre I could make a Prologue to my braines,\\nThey had begun the Play. I sate me downe,\\nDeuis'd a new Commission, wrote it faire,\\nI once did hold it as our Statists doe,\\nA basenesse to write faire; and laboured much\\nHow to forget that learning: but Sir now,\\nIt did me Yeomans seriuce: wilt thou know\\nThe effects of what I wrote?\\n  Hor. I, good my Lord\\n\\n   Ham. An earnest Coniuration from the King,\\nAs England was his faithfull Tributary,\\nAs loue betweene them, as the Palme should flourish,\\nAs Peace should still her wheaten Garland weare,\\nAnd stand a Comma 'tweene their amities,\\nAnd many such like Assis of great charge,\\nThat on the view and know of these Contents,\\nWithout debatement further, more or lesse,\\nHe should the bearers put to sodaine death,\\nNot shriuing time allowed\\n\\n   Hor. How was this seal'd?\\n  Ham. Why, euen in that was Heauen ordinate;\\nI had my fathers Signet in my Purse,\\nWhich was the Modell of that Danish Seale:\\nFolded the Writ vp in forme of the other,\\nSubscrib'd it, gau't th' impression, plac't it safely,\\nThe changeling neuer knowne: Now, the next day\\nWas our Sea Fight, and what to this was sement,\\nThou know'st already\\n\\n   Hor. So Guildensterne and Rosincrance, go too't\\n\\n   Ham. Why man, they did make loue to this imployment\\nThey are not neere my Conscience; their debate\\nDoth by their owne insinuation grow:\\n'Tis dangerous, when the baser nature comes\\nBetweene the passe, and fell incensed points\\nOf mighty opposites\\n\\n   Hor. Why, what a King is this?\\n  Ham. Does it not, thinkst thee, stand me now vpon\\nHe that hath kil'd my King, and whor'd my Mother,\\nPopt in betweene th' election and my hopes,\\nThrowne out his Angle for my proper life,\\nAnd with such coozenage; is't not perfect conscience,\\nTo quit him with this arme? And is't not to be damn'd\\nTo let this Canker of our nature come\\nIn further euill\\n\\n   Hor. It must be shortly knowne to him from England\\nWhat is the issue of the businesse there\\n\\n   Ham. It will be short,\\nThe interim's mine, and a mans life's no more\\nThen to say one: but I am very sorry good Horatio,\\nThat to Laertes I forgot my selfe;\\nFor by the image of my Cause, I see\\nThe Portraiture of his; Ile count his fauours:\\nBut sure the brauery of his griefe did put me\\nInto a Towring passion\\n\\n   Hor. Peace, who comes heere?\\nEnter young Osricke.\\n\\n  Osr. Your Lordship is right welcome back to Denmarke\\n\\n   Ham. I humbly thank you Sir, dost know this waterflie?\\n  Hor. No my good Lord\\n\\n   Ham. Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to\\nknow him: he hath much Land, and fertile; let a Beast\\nbe Lord of Beasts, and his Crib shall stand at the Kings\\nMesse; 'tis a Chowgh; but as I saw spacious in the possession\\nof dirt\\n\\n   Osr. Sweet Lord, if your friendship were at leysure,\\nI should impart a thing to you from his Maiesty\\n\\n   Ham. I will receiue it with all diligence of spirit; put\\nyour Bonet to his right vse, 'tis for the head\\n\\n   Osr. I thanke your Lordship, 'tis very hot\\n\\n   Ham. No, beleeue mee 'tis very cold, the winde is\\nNortherly\\n\\n   Osr. It is indifferent cold my Lord indeed\\n\\n   Ham. Mee thinkes it is very soultry, and hot for my\\nComplexion\\n\\n   Osr. Exceedingly, my Lord, it is very soultry, as 'twere\\nI cannot tell how: but my Lord, his Maiesty bad me signifie\\nto you, that he ha's laid a great wager on your head:\\nSir, this is the matter\\n\\n   Ham. I beseech you remember\\n\\n   Osr. Nay, in good faith, for mine ease in good faith:\\nSir, you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is at\\nhis weapon\\n\\n   Ham. What's his weapon?\\n  Osr. Rapier and dagger\\n\\n   Ham. That's two of his weapons; but well\\n\\n   Osr. The sir King ha's wag'd with him six Barbary horses,\\nagainst the which he impon'd as I take it, sixe French\\nRapiers and Poniards, with their assignes, as Girdle,\\nHangers or so: three of the Carriages infaith are very\\ndeare to fancy, very responsiue to the hilts, most delicate\\ncarriages, and of very liberall conceit\\n\\n   Ham. What call you the Carriages?\\n  Osr. The Carriages Sir, are the hangers\\n\\n   Ham. The phrase would bee more Germaine to the\\nmatter: If we could carry Cannon by our sides; I would\\nit might be Hangers till then; but on sixe Barbary Horses\\nagainst sixe French Swords: their Assignes, and three\\nliberall conceited Carriages, that's the French but against\\nthe Danish; why is this impon'd as you call it?\\n  Osr. The King Sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene\\nyou and him, hee shall not exceed you three hits;\\nHe hath one twelue for mine, and that would come to\\nimediate tryall, if your Lordship would vouchsafe the\\nAnswere\\n\\n   Ham. How if I answere no?\\n  Osr. I meane my Lord, the opposition of your person\\nin tryall\\n\\n   Ham. Sir, I will walke heere in the Hall; if it please\\nhis Maiestie, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let\\nthe Foyles bee brought, the Gentleman willing, and the\\nKing hold his purpose; I will win for him if I can: if\\nnot, Ile gaine nothing but my shame, and the odde hits\\n\\n   Osr. Shall I redeliuer you ee'n so?\\n  Ham. To this effect Sir, after what flourish your nature\\nwill\\n\\n   Osr. I commend my duty to your Lordship\\n\\n   Ham. Yours, yours; hee does well to commend it\\nhimselfe, there are no tongues else for's tongue\\n\\n   Hor. This Lapwing runs away with the shell on his\\nhead\\n\\n   Ham. He did Complie with his Dugge before hee\\nsuck't it: thus had he and mine more of the same Beauty\\nthat I know the drossie age dotes on; only got the tune of\\nthe time, and outward habite of encounter, a kinde of\\nyesty collection, which carries them through & through\\nthe most fond and winnowed opinions; and doe but blow\\nthem to their tryalls: the Bubbles are out\\n\\n   Hor. You will lose this wager, my Lord\\n\\n   Ham. I doe not thinke so, since he went into France,\\nI haue beene in continuall practice; I shall winne at the\\noddes: but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about\\nmy heart: but it is no matter\\n\\n   Hor. Nay, good my Lord\\n\\n   Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kinde of\\ngain-giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman\\n\\n   Hor. If your minde dislike any thing, obey. I will forestall\\ntheir repaire hither, and say you are not fit\\n\\n   Ham. Not a whit, we defie Augury; there's a speciall\\nProuidence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not\\nto come: if it bee not to come, it will bee now: if it\\nbe not now; yet it will come; the readinesse is all, since no\\nman ha's ought of what he leaues. What is't to leaue betimes?\\nEnter King, Queene, Laertes and Lords, with other Attendants with\\nFoyles,\\nand Gauntlets, a Table and Flagons of Wine on it.\\n\\n  Kin. Come Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me\\n\\n   Ham. Giue me your pardon Sir, I'ue done you wrong,\\nBut pardon't as you are a Gentleman.\\nThis presence knowes,\\nAnd you must needs haue heard how I am punisht\\nWith sore distraction? What I haue done\\nThat might your nature honour, and exception\\nRoughly awake, I heere proclaime was madnesse:\\nWas't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Neuer Hamlet.\\nIf Hamlet from himselfe be tane away:\\nAnd when he's not himselfe, do's wrong Laertes,\\nThen Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it:\\nWho does it then? His Madnesse? If't be so,\\nHamlet is of the Faction that is wrong'd,\\nHis madnesse is poore Hamlets Enemy.\\nSir, in this Audience,\\nLet my disclaiming from a purpos'd euill,\\nFree me so farre in your most generous thoughts,\\nThat I haue shot mine Arrow o're the house,\\nAnd hurt my Mother\\n\\n   Laer. I am satisfied in Nature,\\nWhose motiue in this case should stirre me most\\nTo my Reuenge. But in my termes of Honor\\nI stand aloofe, and will no reconcilement,\\nTill by some elder Masters of knowne Honor,\\nI haue a voyce, and president of peace\\nTo keepe my name vngorg'd. But till that time,\\nI do receiue your offer'd loue like loue,\\nAnd wil not wrong it\\n\\n   Ham. I do embrace it freely,\\nAnd will this Brothers wager frankely play.\\nGiue vs the Foyles: Come on\\n\\n   Laer. Come one for me\\n\\n   Ham. Ile be your foile Laertes, in mine ignorance,\\nYour Skill shall like a Starre i'th' darkest night,\\nSticke fiery off indeede\\n\\n   Laer. You mocke me Sir\\n\\n   Ham. No by this hand\\n\\n   King. Giue them the Foyles yong Osricke,\\nCousen Hamlet, you know the wager\\n\\n   Ham. Verie well my Lord,\\nYour Grace hath laide the oddes a'th' weaker side\\n\\n   King. I do not feare it,\\nI haue seene you both:\\nBut since he is better'd, we haue therefore oddes\\n\\n   Laer. This is too heauy,\\nLet me see another\\n\\n   Ham. This likes me well,\\nThese Foyles haue all a length.\\n\\nPrepare to play.\\n\\n  Osricke. I my good Lord\\n\\n   King. Set me the Stopes of wine vpon that Table:\\nIf Hamlet giue the first, or second hit,\\nOr quit in answer of the third exchange,\\nLet all the Battlements their Ordinance fire,\\nThe King shal drinke to Hamlets better breath,\\nAnd in the Cup an vnion shal he throw\\nRicher then that, which foure successiue Kings\\nIn Denmarkes Crowne haue worne.\\nGiue me the Cups,\\nAnd let the Kettle to the Trumpets speake,\\nThe Trumpet to the Cannoneer without,\\nThe Cannons to the Heauens, the Heauen to Earth,\\nNow the King drinkes to Hamlet. Come, begin,\\nAnd you the Iudges beare a wary eye\\n\\n   Ham. Come on sir\\n\\n   Laer. Come on sir.\\n\\nThey play.\\n\\n  Ham. One\\n\\n   Laer. No\\n\\n   Ham. Iudgement\\n\\n   Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit\\n\\n   Laer. Well: againe\\n\\n   King. Stay, giue me drinke.\\nHamlet, this Pearle is thine,\\nHere's to thy health. Giue him the cup,\\n\\nTrumpets sound, and shot goes off.\\n\\n  Ham. Ile play this bout first, set by a-while.\\nCome: Another hit; what say you?\\n  Laer. A touch, a touch, I do confesse\\n\\n   King. Our Sonne shall win\\n\\n   Qu. He's fat, and scant of breath.\\nHeere's a Napkin, rub thy browes,\\nThe Queene Carowses to thy fortune, Hamlet\\n\\n   Ham. Good Madam\\n\\n   King. Gertrude, do not drinke\\n\\n   Qu. I will my Lord;\\nI pray you pardon me\\n\\n   King. It is the poyson'd Cup, it is too late\\n\\n   Ham. I dare not drinke yet Madam,\\nBy and by\\n\\n   Qu. Come, let me wipe thy face\\n\\n   Laer. My Lord, Ile hit him now\\n\\n   King. I do not thinke't\\n\\n   Laer. And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience\\n\\n   Ham. Come for the third.\\nLaertes, you but dally,\\nI pray you passe with your best violence,\\nI am affear'd you make a wanton of me\\n\\n   Laer. Say you so? Come on.\\n\\nPlay.\\n\\n  Osr. Nothing neither way\\n\\n   Laer. Haue at you now.\\n\\nIn scuffling they change Rapiers.\\n\\n  King. Part them, they are incens'd\\n\\n   Ham. Nay come, againe\\n\\n   Osr. Looke to the Queene there hoa\\n\\n   Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is't my Lord?\\n  Osr. How is't Laertes?\\n  Laer. Why as a Woodcocke\\nTo mine Sprindge, Osricke,\\nI am iustly kill'd with mine owne Treacherie\\n\\n   Ham. How does the Queene?\\n  King. She sounds to see them bleede\\n\\n   Qu. No, no, the drinke, the drinke.\\nOh my deere Hamlet, the drinke, the drinke,\\nI am poyson'd\\n\\n   Ham. Oh Villany! How? Let the doore be lock'd.\\nTreacherie, seeke it out\\n\\n   Laer. It is heere Hamlet.\\nHamlet, thou art slaine,\\nNo Medicine in the world can do thee good.\\nIn thee, there is not halfe an houre of life;\\nThe Treacherous Instrument is in thy hand,\\nVnbated and envenom'd: the foule practise\\nHath turn'd it selfe on me. Loe, heere I lye,\\nNeuer to rise againe: Thy Mothers poyson'd:\\nI can no more, the King, the King's too blame\\n\\n   Ham. The point envenom'd too,\\nThen venome to thy worke.\\n\\nHurts the King.\\n\\n  All. Treason, Treason\\n\\n   King. O yet defend me Friends, I am but hurt\\n\\n   Ham. Heere thou incestuous, murdrous,\\nDamned Dane,\\nDrinke off this Potion: Is thy Vnion heere?\\nFollow my Mother.\\n\\nKing Dyes.\\n\\n  Laer. He is iustly seru'd.\\nIt is a poyson temp'red by himselfe:\\nExchange forgiuenesse with me, Noble Hamlet;\\nMine and my Fathers death come not vpon thee,\\nNor thine on me.\\n\\nDyes.\\n\\n  Ham. Heauen make thee free of it, I follow thee.\\nI am dead Horatio, wretched Queene adiew,\\nYou that looke pale, and tremble at this chance,\\nThat are but Mutes or audience to this acte:\\nHad I but time (as this fell Sergeant death\\nIs strick'd in his Arrest) oh I could tell you.\\nBut let it be: Horatio, I am dead,\\nThou liu'st, report me and my causes right\\nTo the vnsatisfied\\n\\n   Hor. Neuer beleeue it.\\nI am more an Antike Roman then a Dane:\\nHeere's yet some Liquor left\\n\\n   Ham. As th'art a man, giue me the Cup.\\nLet go, by Heauen Ile haue't.\\nOh good Horatio, what a wounded name,\\n(Things standing thus vnknowne) shall liue behind me.\\nIf thou did'st euer hold me in thy heart,\\nAbsent thee from felicitie awhile,\\nAnd in this harsh world draw thy breath in paine,\\nTo tell my Storie.\\n\\nMarch afarre off, and shout within.\\n\\nWhat warlike noyse is this?\\nEnter Osricke.\\n\\n  Osr. Yong Fortinbras, with conquest come fro[m] Poland\\nTo th' Ambassadors of England giues this warlike volly\\n\\n   Ham. O I dye Horatio:\\nThe potent poyson quite ore-crowes my spirit,\\nI cannot liue to heare the Newes from England,\\nBut I do prophesie th' election lights\\nOn Fortinbras, he ha's my dying voyce,\\nSo tell him with the occurrents more and lesse,\\nWhich haue solicited. The rest is silence. O, o, o, o.\\n\\nDyes\\n\\n  Hora. Now cracke a Noble heart:\\nGoodnight sweet Prince,\\nAnd flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest,\\nWhy do's the Drumme come hither?\\nEnter Fortinbras and English Ambassador, with Drumme, Colours,\\nand\\nAttendants.\\n\\n  Fortin. Where is this sight?\\n  Hor. What is it ye would see;\\nIf ought of woe, or wonder, cease your search\\n\\n   For. His quarry cries on hauocke. Oh proud death,\\nWhat feast is toward in thine eternall Cell.\\nThat thou so many Princes, at a shoote,\\nSo bloodily hast strooke\\n\\n   Amb. The sight is dismall,\\nAnd our affaires from England come too late,\\nThe eares are senselesse that should giue vs hearing,\\nTo tell him his command'ment is fulfill'd,\\nThat Rosincrance and Guildensterne are dead:\\nWhere should we haue our thankes?\\n  Hor. Not from his mouth,\\nHad it th' abilitie of life to thanke you:\\nHe neuer gaue command'ment for their death.\\nBut since so iumpe vpon this bloodie question,\\nYou from the Polake warres, and you from England\\nAre heere arriued. Giue order that these bodies\\nHigh on a stage be placed to the view,\\nAnd let me speake to th' yet vnknowing world,\\nHow these things came about. So shall you heare\\nOf carnall, bloudie, and vnnaturall acts,\\nOf accidentall iudgements, casuall slaughters\\nOf death's put on by cunning, and forc'd cause,\\nAnd in this vpshot, purposes mistooke,\\nFalne on the Inuentors head. All this can I\\nTruly deliuer\\n\\n   For. Let vs hast to heare it,\\nAnd call the Noblest to the Audience.\\nFor me, with sorrow, I embrace my Fortune,\\nI haue some Rites of memory in this Kingdome,\\nWhich are to claime, my vantage doth\\nInuite me,\\n  Hor. Of that I shall haue alwayes cause to speake,\\nAnd from his mouth\\nWhose voyce will draw on more:\\nBut let this same be presently perform'd,\\nEuen whiles mens mindes are wilde,\\nLest more mischance\\nOn plots, and errors happen\\n\\n   For. Let foure Captaines\\nBeare Hamlet like a Soldier to the Stage,\\nFor he was likely, had he beene put on\\nTo haue prou'd most royally:\\nAnd for his passage,\\nThe Souldiours Musicke, and the rites of Warre\\nSpeake lowdly for him.\\nTake vp the body; Such a sight as this\\nBecomes the Field, but heere shewes much amis.\\nGo, bid the Souldiers shoote.\\n\\nExeunt. Marching: after the which, a Peale of Ordenance are shot\\noff.\\n\\n\\nFINIS. The tragedie of HAMLET, Prince of Denmarke.\\n\""
